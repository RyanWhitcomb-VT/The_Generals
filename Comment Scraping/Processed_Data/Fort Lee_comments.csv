360,148755278523144_1285053808226613,"So, to continue on a comment that I left previously on this gate change issue.  Your answer was that (and I quote): ""Traffic studies were performed and of the gates open on the weekends, the Mahone Gate had the least traffic.""  Your closing to your response indicated it was chosen because it was determined to have the least amount of impact.                                                                                                               First, I can understand the issue of availability of personnel.  That will have to play in any decisions, so I would never discount that.                                                                                                                 Second, however, let's correct the term used in your answer: Mahone gate had the lesser amount of traffic, because you use that term when comparing only two items.  Using ""least"" would require more than two data points, which clearly was not the case.  Currently, only two gates are open and only two have been open for some time on the weekends:  Mahone and Sisisky, and it has been that way for quite some time now (current posting on the installation website lists current hours effective January 19, 2016, but that extended hours at Mahone gate at a minimum).  So, the 24 hour gate that has to this point been the location at which all installation passes were issued and (by those two points) by default would clearly always have the greater traffic of the two available gates for access at those times.  I have to conclude that this was a pre-made decision in search of some data to document that pre-decision in a post-decision fashion.  Let's call it what it appears to be: a prior decision that had to be justified (and possibly wasting additional funds to conduct it) for publicity and public consumption by a ""study"" (and given the nature of existing gate availability, a false study) that would clearly show the 24-hour gate to carry greater traffic, just so opening Lee gate could be justified.                                                                                                                    It is a false comparison to base the decision on a comparison of traffic levels when the reality automatically skews the data.  What were the comparable alternatives to the one chosen?  What normalization of data was accomplished, if any?  It is clear that Sisisky has to remain open - or is it?  The truth is that the shift is being done to accommodate the shifting of the passes issuance to Lee gate welcome center - that is the sole, publicly known reason for the change.  That reality is also a reason to question why traffic levels is the apparent decision factor: Using traffic levels as a factor in determination to shift issuance of passes on the weekends is not appropriate for closing a gate which has no capability to issue passes (again, automatic and false skewing).  If it is necessary to consider shifting pass issuance due to circumstances existing at Sisisky gate, logic and standard analytuical process would specify that only like type capabilities can be considered for compartitive alternatives - in other words, at which gates is there a capability for pass issuance in this case?                                                                                                                  Why, if the passes issuance shift to Lee gate is the requirement, could Sisisky gate not close on the weekend?  What would be the true difficulty to push the traffic to Lee gate - just as was done when Sisisky was closed earlier this year - and for all the years prior to Sisisky opening?   In fact, given the necessity to issue passes at Lee gate on the weekends, the traffic through Sisisky gate will inherently be reduced.  Both gates have two inbound lanes and two outbound lanes.  As others have said, traffic inbound due to the pass issues, will back up onto route 36.  But, now we are going to have weekend installation access effectively at one point (despite two gates):  Route 36.  Now, instead of enabling the quickest traffic routing to I-95 to local points of interest northbound (e.g., Southpark Mall or even to Richmond), all traffic to and from Fort Lee is forced to route through Petersburg or Colonial Heights, dumping that traffic onto already excessively overtaxed already.                                                                                                          Too many unknown parts and pieces to this; too many other analytical questions in my mind that I know the installation isn't answering - maybe because such questions weren't considered.  Again, despite any other publicly stated reasons, it appears this was a pre-decision in search of justifying ""study"" data to support that pre-formed decision.",2016-08-03T13:43:38+0000,1285053808226613_1293658727366121,10152548016853602,0

I can't count on my hands and feet the number of times that traffic turning left into the Lee gate has blocked traffic going eastbound on Rte. 36 in the mornings.  And there's a perpetual backup there because the time it takes the gate personnel to clear the traffic, the light is 3/4 of the way through the cycle.  Make Sisisky the main gate and spare us the hassle in the mornings.  The Sisisky gate has more length of road before the actual gate anyway, thereby reducing the number of cars in the intersection blocking a main thoroughfare.",2016-07-21T22:22:20+0000,1285053808226613_1285123111553016,10201632859858401,3

I live in central avenue #175, Apartment 501, Viena building, De Met unit, colonia San Pedro de los Pinos, M?xico City, M?xico. 
He wants to kill me because I know several of his contacts in M?xico and in NY, and all of them are going to make look my death as a suicide; here some people I know that work for him:
-Juan Carlos Morales Mercado (Facebook M?xico former employee)
-Ren? Fajer Garfias and Jimena Rodr?guez de Fajer, working in L'oreal NY and living in Manhattan
-V?ctor Job, Havas media group former employee, M?xico City
-Joaqu?n Peralta Hern?ndez, M?xico City 
-Joaqu?n Peralta Guti?rrez, M?xico City

I think he has paid a lot of police and politicians men in M?xico and some FBI and DEA men, because I have sent e mails and compliances to this agencies with this information and no one has helped me or even answered me, you will find more information in this facebook.
They use Facebook and mass media to intimidate me, they look for people selling properties, they use ALATORRE BIENES RA?CES (Jes?s Alatorre) to pay you, steal the money and use that account to money laundry (stealing previously your ID (IFE), in my case they use Rub?n Luna Bernal as the ""buyer"", I have papers and videos to prove all these.
Besides my  complaint in PGJ (FDF/T/T3/00772/14-10). Since 1 year a go he is threathening my 6 years old nephew, he told me (by Facebook notices) he'll cut him in several pieces and send him to me in a box, please help me, I am so scared, please help me. He is tall, white and fat; he also has a house in R?o de Janeiro, Brasil. He uses army anti terrorist techniques on me.",2016-02-28T23:27:09+0000,1152175838181078_1166968606701801,1441250802863263,0

698,148755278523144_1148359175229411,"Message from Fort Lee Senior Commander MG Darrell K. Williams:

Team,

I approve opening the installation on Tues, 26 Jan.  Additionally, I'm authorizing a 2 hour delay and liberal leave. Individual tenant organizations (outside of CASCOM) have the flexibility to approve more liberal arrangements based upon their individual assessments, risk to mission and risk to their workforces.  

These decisions are intended to provide maximum flexibility for safe travel into and on the installation, while also facilitating mission accomplishment. There is still snow on the installation, so conditions will be SAFE but not perfect.  

I encourage ALL LEADERS to conduct local risk assessments and TAKE ACTION to prevent any accidents or unfortunate events.  The installation's staff is working extremely hard to restore full functionality.  Nonetheless, we need everyone's assistance, cooperation and patience. I want to thank everyone for your teamwork and cooperation during this historic event. Given record snowfalls, collectively we took prudent steps to mitigate any negative impacts on the SAFETY of our workforce and accomplishment of the mission.  

To date, we have authorized early departure on Thurs 21 Jan, closed the installation on Fri, 22 Jan through the weekend ending 24 Jan. I also approved closure of the installation on Mon 25 Jan to allow both the Garrison and our tenant organizations to prepare for resumption of full-scale operations.  

As we return to work starting tomorrow, I encourage everyone to be SAFE.  If there are additional actions local to buildings and parking lots that require attention, again I expect LEADERS to TAKE ACTION! 

Again, thanks and let's execute a smooth return to normal operations.

924,148755278523144_1141506702581325,This is really strange since Homeland Security is not requiring these states to change until 2018 for airline travel.  Seems as if the DOD is asking more from citizens then Homeland Security does which will create extra cost to citizens would seem to be unfair.  The need to carry documents to prove that you were born in the USA is particularly hard on military family members who move often and the misplacing or losing them could be a problem.  To get copies of birth certificates or other documents is not done for free so what happens is that the price continues to build perhaps making access to for retirees to be out of reach if they are on limited or fixed income.  Why not wait until 2018 when the Homeland Security rule does into effect across the nation?,2016-01-13T14:47:29+0000,1141506702581325_1142140382517957,770522026315865,0

1565,148755278523144_841968122535186,"Why is the CDC limited to only Prince George schools when it adjoins Petersburg, Hopewell and Colonial Heights? 

Currently there are vacancies in housing which have been advertised the entire year I've been here, but DoD civilians and retirees are not permitted to live on base as they are on several other posts. Housing off base, besides substandard apartments, is very limited in Prince George, forcing employees further away from post, which in turn increases safety issues especially during winter season. And, contributes greatly to missed work by those employees due to dealing with school closings. 
Lets not even go into the equity of quality of education between Petersburg and PG schools.  I think it's a travesty that parents must choose between affordable housing or quality education for their children. 

Most civilians are prior military, military retirees or have served the federal government for years. Telling us that our children are less important than our active duty, temporarily assigned, counterparts is insulting.  

Having either the ability to move on post, open up the CDC to the adjoining cities, or to allow Fort Lee employees children attend PG schools (and even paying a tuition fee if necessary) would be beneficial to the workforce that sustains the student Army mission, DECA and DCMA, as well as other agencies on post employing federal civilians.

But also for those that service the soldiers on fort lee. So please keep in mind that he also has regulations to follow and a budget that is in place for all of these things on this base. I give him credit for doing as much as he has done with the cards he is dealt when bad weather hits us. This is about all of us pulling together as a team on this base and supporting each other if u need something shoveled put the word out on the fort lee pages and someone will help you.

How can they lead others who have deployed sooo many times. A soldier of E-4 status deployed 2 times and one that never deployed but is E-6 and is suppose to train the others for deployment. Start sending those who need that kind of background before leading others and stop sending the same ones over and over.

Of note:  ""The other element coming fully online soon is the Communicator NXT. This is a system that calls, sends texts, emails and, eventually, computer pop-ups when there is an emergency situation. The NXT is a voluntary ?opt-in? notification system that anyone affiliated with Fort Lee can sign up for and receive the emergency notifications. It also will be available for the tenants on Fort Lee for their official use with certain limitations. Like the other systems, NXT will be tested regularly although not to the extent to make people opt-out due to over use.""",2012-08-15T21:41:22+0000,260594044057670_1008558,148755278523144,0

- If flooding occurs, get to higher ground. Get out of areas subject to flooding. This includes dips, low spots, canyons, washes, etc.

- Avoid areas already flooded, especially if the water is flowing fast. Do not attempt to cross flowing streams.

- Road beds may be washed out under flood waters. Never drive through flooded roadways. If your vehicle is caught in rising water, leave it immediately and seek higher ground.

- Do not camp or park your vehicle along streams and washes, particularly during threatening conditions.
