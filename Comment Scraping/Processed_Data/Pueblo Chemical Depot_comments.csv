101,190556161005811_617886598272763,Thank you Kenneth Roque For helping me out and posting this . This is such an awesome cause and I'm so proud to be able to be a part of the Colorado fire fighter calendar and its cause . Out side of being in the calendar and all the fancy stuff that goes with that I've been able to see and do so much with the families and kids who have been through these tragedies . It has felt amazing to be able to do that and I never would have been able to do the things I've done without being a part of the calendar . I often think God forbid what if it was my family or my kids who had been through that. Makes me appreciate that much more what this calendar does to help and I'm very proud . Thank you and if you'd like to help you can buy a calendar for a gift or yourself and if not you can also just donate whatever you'd like . I hope you all have a great day and week .
