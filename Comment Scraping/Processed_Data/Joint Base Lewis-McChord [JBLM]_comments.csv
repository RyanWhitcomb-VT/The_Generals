I would like to offer a suggestion regarding the library hour change though: please consider being closed Sunday/Monday instead of the new Saturday/Sunday closure. Every time I've taken my teen to the ""Teen Takeover"" activity on Thursdays, I've seen soldiers walk up to the doors at a little after 1800 with laptops and textbooks, who then have no access because the library closed at 1800. Being open on Saturday makes this valuable resource available to families and service members trying to further their education, and their careers, through school. Another option would be to stay with M-F hours, but adjust them so active duty folks have evening access. Perhaps a couple of days could be bumped to 1100-2000 instead of 0900-1800 for Grandstaff? While the Lakewood branch of Pierce County Library offers some later hours, not everyone has transportation off-base or feels safe in that area at night. This would keep the number of hours shortened the same way as the new Saturday closure, but would open up the library for use by those who don't walk out of the office at 1600 on the dot. It's been really sad to see folks trying to use library resources walk away from the doors at 1815 - worse now if they won't have Saturday access.

Good thing the wind on Saturday was not out of the north or the dirt would have been a nightmare for the concrete area as well. Maybe VIP, Vets and some general parking on the dirt and food booths and carnival on the concrete. Must get the cars off of I-5. That was dangerous.

We've been in FPCON Bravo for years... I'm a little concerned with the amount of clearance people get by being able to come on base. I heard the air show was amazing and successful.... Just when it comes to families feeling unsure about people driving through areas they shouldn't be allowed in...

762,288818151198_10153606380661199,"I see so many people complaint about the locations of booths and lack of activities for kids.. The reason for the lack of activities and lack of a lot of things Is they had to cut the vendors in half because they could not get the help from volunteers from either units or frgs.. They had some day labor ready people working but when no one wants to help to gets things going to complain...
I went on there Friday afternoon to watch the show and ended up cleaning fryers and putting up tents and cleaning utinsils for the venders to have to serve with and getting their stands ready was out in 90 plus degree weather seeing these people obviously needed help and where struggling..
I am not saying I am better than anyone but sometimes look around or ask they had been trying to set this up since the Wednesday before the show and barley got it ready in enough time Friday to open Saturday.. 
I also think as a community we need to take more pride in helping out with all events. I also helped Saturday and Sunday and I saw so much disrespect towards the vendors and each other trash just being thrown on the ground.. For what you to leave and complain over not having stuff for your kids or not having the speakers not being loud enough or too loud.. Well pick up your trash and lend a hand and maybe you will get what you want.. After all you got to park for free a shuttle for free and free show and entrance...

763,288818151198_10153606380661199,"As a civilian, I enjoyed the show very much - with a couple small exceptions...  The sound system at the show line was way too loud, ended up with a headache by the end of the day.  The (non  USAF/USN/Army) announcing was pretty much akin to a morning radio yak fest, and the frequent playing of recorded events from other air shows was...  I had to chuckle as folks looked all around for the Coast Guard rescue demonstration that was only on the jumbotron, invisible from near the Tower. 

Service members were very helpful, especially when I got lost in my wheelchair trying to get back to the shuttle bus stop.  I felt deep pride watching Thunderbird Boss leading the oath for the new enlistees.  

Otherwise, as mentioned elsewhere - perhaps some more military aircraft flight displays?  F-22, B-2, B-1, F-35, and helicopters from the Army?  Yeah, I know, fuel ain't cheap, but I'd rather pay taxes for 'training time' than some other shenanigans going on these days...

766,288818151198_10153606380661199,"In years past, the McChord shows I have attended (2001, 2008, 2010) have absolutely been LEGENDARY!  B-1, B-2 flyby, mass C-17 drops, Airfield Assault Demo, MiG-15, Sabre, Fury, Phantom, F-16/F-15/A-10 demos in addition to the usual Super Hornet, Huey/Cobra demo, jetcar race, etc.  This year's lineup from day one was minimal at best.  This year, in fact, was the only one where I've been in town and actually chose to stay home Friday and Sunday.  I understand there is a lot that goes into planning events and scheduling acts, so there's only so much one can do.  You guys had no control over the weather, which was unfortunate, but I have no complaints about delays or routine scratches.  The performers that were able to get up were FANTASTIC!  

As a McChord air show vet, I knew traffic on and off base would be bad, which is why my friends and I showed up at 7:50 AM and planned on staying well after the TB's landed to photograph statics for a few hours.  

However, some things we noticed.  First of all, not allowing folks to park prior to 9:00AM.  In years past we were allowed on base well before the airshow gates opened.  This wasted an hour forcing us to park along the street.  It would be great if you were able to return to what had been done previously and allow folks on base a little early, so that we could then get in line to actually enter the airshow grounds at opening.  Secondly, once we were on base, navigating to available parking was terribly confusing.  It was simply ""follow the car in front of you and hope they know where they are going"" as there were NO signs, and NOBODY to direct us.  One Airman told us to park, ""wherever there is an empty spot"" to which another Airman said, ""you can't park here.  I don't know where you can park.""  More wasting of time.  And that's exactly why I woke up at 4:30 in the morning to get this McChord adventure started.

***  However, my No. 1 complaint is the two clowns you gave the microphones to.  Greg Pierce and Kirk Skaggs.  First of all, most of the information they provided was either COMPLETELY made up on the spot or came out in such a confusing way, nobody knew what they were even talking about to begin with.  On Saturday, Kirk was talking about the high winds and actually said, ""the wind could cause an airplane to catch a stall.""  One time he said either the Navion or B-25 (again, confusing phrasing) was the grandchild of the P-51 Mustang.  At another point he said, ""You know, Greg, the B-1 Bone is a... ah... a moving aircraft.""  Bomber?  Supersonic? No.  It's ""moving.""  Also commented that the P-58 (should be P-38) was also a moving aircraft. Other things included directing people to look left when the plane was coming from the right, HORRIBLE transitions that left us confused, and the deep announcer voice he was trying to get across just sounded like a bad Batman impersonation.  My friends and I were literally laughing out loud the entire time these two were speaking.  You guys can go back to LiveAirShowTV and watch Sunday's show and listen to how horrible it was.  

I like to shoot video at airshows.  Having the announcer is OK, but when the announcers spew utter crap, it completely ruins everything.  Not even worth uploading, and makes it a waste of time and money for me.  

And for those that want to say, ""it's a tough job, YOU should give it a try and see how easy it is!"" my response is:  PLEASE LET ME!  I know my aircraft, I know aviation, I know my history, and I'm a teacher, so I know a thing or two about public speaking.",2016-09-01T03:45:30+0000,10153606380661199_10153610285971199,10100354201005533,2
767,288818151198_10153606380661199,"Please open up parking an hour before the gate opens to the show grounds. This would eliminate the back up that was created at the gate that stretched out to I-5 on Saturday - As far as the show goes, I know the wind was a factor, but 2-3 more plane demonstrations would have been nice and eliminated those long gaps between acts. And lastly, the announcer was lame, bordering on being painful, how many more times could he have talked about how refreshing Pepsi is, he clearly was out of things to say while waiting for the next demo to start.",2016-08-30T18:05:28+0000,10153606380661199_10153606418666199,692557924153417,4

Our socks and legs were coated in dirt because of the wind blowing up.  Our grandchildren got a ton of dirt in their eyes.  I know a lot of people liked the carnival, but I personally wished it wasn't there.  Our grandkids were more interested in it, instead of the show.  The airshow is for them to go through the planes and watch the planes, not wanting to go to the carnival.  I don't know if it is just us, but I thought a lot of the food prices were quite high, I know they are fund raisers so I was just okay with paying $5 for just a hotdog.  But come on that is more than double the price of a regular dog.  They could have added a bag of chips and still made a ton of money.",2016-08-30T23:57:22+0000,10153606380661199_10153607215186199,813079842049716,1

773,288818151198_10153606380661199,"The soldiers/airmen, etc... who are manning the aircraft, tanks, guns, etc... on the ground should have some training or protocol in monitoring the amount of time individuals can spend looking/checking things out (for example, we went inside the C-130, I believe it was, and the line was long - no big deal there. However, at one point, the line stalled for nearly 30 minutes without moving even a foot because whoever had gone into the cockpit didn't want to come out. I LOVE that the planes were out there and that we are able to go explore them - that is SO cool and our kids loved it; the airmen were wonderful about answering questions, explaining things, etc... however, if there was say a 5 minute (or any set amount) time limit per person/group that goes in, it would really keep the line moving efficiently, and help cut down on the wait time for those still in line and wanting to do other things. (We arrived at the air show around 9:30 a.m.and went straight through the gates. The first thing we did was the C-130, and it was after 11:30 by the time we got through the line and made it out the other end of the plane, despite the line not being very long when we got in it. It was REALLY cool to see/do, but if visitors were not permitted to just sit and take all the time they want (whether it is 5 minutes or 25 minutes), and were rather kept on a regular rotation, it seems it would go much more smoothly and efficiently for all involved, allowing more people to see the aircraft.",2016-08-30T19:45:20+0000,10153606380661199_10153606594061199,688698684568152,2

We stopped rolling sleeves for good reasons, notably loose fitting long sleeves keep you cooler in the sun and protect the arms while working from sunburn, insects, and minor injuries.....for active soldiers, that is.  Now we will roll sleeves, exposing soldiers to a higher risk of heat injuries, limiting mobility of the biceps and arms, and irritating lower arm injuries,  simply for vanity.  If we want a short sleeve uniform in garrison, we have one.  It's the ASU class B.  Not sure we want to go there.  But if inactive soldiers want to show off their lower arms, maybe that's the right answer.  Active soldiers will constantly be rolling sleeves up and taking them back down, just like we used to do.  It will be a real pain and take up time better spent soldiering.  I hope JBLM does not require sleeve rolls, even for summer formations.

2243,288818151198_10153211498031199,"Ummm ya...except the Wa DOL is not ready to issue ""RealID"" cards that most states issue...so you HAVE to get a enhanced border crossing ID.  It takes 2-3 weeks after applying to obtain your permanent ID...which will prob be even longer now the JBLM frequent visitors will flood the DOL.  you have to go to DOL with a bunch of ID paperwork and a form and apply.  This DOL information page has a link to get to the requirements for the enhanced license.   BIG fail Washington state!!

I mean you wouldn't let your kids on a school bus with someone who doesn't know how to drive a bus.  It's great they can train at home rather than having to leave AGAIN to train in a remote site where communications with family are limited because of lack of cell towers etc..

I was walking past a tall wooden fence the other day, you know the kind you see outside a building site. As I walked along beside it I heard chanting coming from behind the fence further up... they were chanting numbers, or rather just one number.

""Thirteen, thirteen, thirteen, thirteen, ..."" they excitedly chanted. It sounded like a small crowd, young and old; men, women and children. All of them saying the same number over and over.

As I approached I saw a small hole in the fence just big enough to look through. The hole was right where the sound appeared to be originating from.

So, with the crowd continuing to chant ""... thirteen, thirteen, thirteen, thirteen"" and it seeming to become more intense as I leaned down to place my eye at the hole and work out WTF was happening in there.

Just as I put my eye to the hole a small finger like that of a child poked me in the eye and the crowd stared cheered loudly and started chanting again..

2669,288818151198_10153121997106199,"I think this is a great option for moms and I commend Madigan for providing such an thing. However, I would rather see more effort and funding be put into privacy concerns for postpartum patients. Putting two plus moms in a room, with their newborns, after hours in labor and delivery is frustrating for the patients and can raise sanitary concerns. It's hard to recover and bond when you are forced into a room with an equally frustrated and tired woman, with no room for either of you to have a family member come and help with baby. For example, my husband had to bring a lawn chair to be able to sit in our post delivery room when the nurses informed my room mate and I that we could only have one chair in the room for safety reasons. We certainly understood those concerns and staff request, but we were both frustrated that between the two of us we could only have one visitor at a time. After 20 hours in labor, my child and I needed to rest. That was impossible when my husband was sent home less than two hours after birth, my roommates child cried all night, and I was a fall risk and could not get out of bed without assistance. We were both so exhausted the next day that we were falling asleep sitting up and in the middle of forming sentences. I know the nurses hate having to put two patients in one room as well and try to accommodate when they can, but they can only do so much with the resources they have. Does Madigan have any future plans to alleviate some of those issues?",2016-01-09T05:41:45+0000,10153121997106199_10153122934931199,10100226147607209,8

He brings a wealth of knowledge and a deep passion for history that can only make our Lewis Army Museum better. I always enjoyed our sometimes spirited discussions on some of the famous and even little know battles in history.. I always left discussions with him motivated to learn more...he really is a great teacher...I would highly encourage anyone with even a little interest in preserving our military history to pay him a visit and see how you can help... I promise you, they will find some way for you to help and even enjoy yourself while volunteering...Again, proud of Eric and I know he'll always get the job done...????????",2015-12-22T18:57:14+0000,10153091832741199_10153091933451199,10205883905990623,2

They didn't amend the selective service. If woman can serve in combat now. When congress activates the draft. All able bodied women same age as the men should be drafted. Second. They are going to figure out only 20%( I'm being gracious with this estimate) of women are physically able to meet the demand of frontline combat. Plus won't be able to serve as long because they are twice (again being gracious on the estimate) more prone to injury. Lastly. They are doing this all or nothing move without any forethought. They researched multicam for 4+ years before they finally decided the obvious, it was a better uniform. They didn't put any research or forethought how to get through the beginning processes of integrating women into combat units. This is potentially a disaster. If they recruit to many to fast. And they will because it's a political move. These female soldiers will be placed in a world where everything is still designed for men only. They just recently gave women their own cut of body armor. They will need more specialized gear( if you wish to cut down injury). I'm still curious how a shy female is gonna pee in the back of a Stryker or Bradley while on an extended patrol? I know the answer to this too. Same way we do. In a bottle. She is just gonna have to get over showing herself off to her squad mates... That's the reality of serving in combat. This is the same army that when an afghan LT tried to kiss an American Captain. We moved all our females to besides the officers tents and put C wire around it than had a dismount patrol check on it every hour on the hour for month afterward. Which was promptly nicknamed rape patrol. All because an army captain couldn't handle an unwanted advance.

3600,288818151198_10152943025536199,"I have a question, Admin. This mentions a readiness plan in the event of an earthquake, but I'm curious if you know anything about any evac plans for a volcanic eruption? The problem with earthquakes is that especially along the ""Ring of Fire"" and in the Cascade range is that all of these mountains, some 15-17 peaks are active volcanoes. And earthquakes paired with plate tectonics along a fault line is usually accompanied with volcanic eruption. The plates shift and can weaken a mountains structure, add shaking quaking and you may very well have a bad brew of natural disasters. 

Is JBLM taking precautions in the event that lahars sweep through? Or God-forbid a pyroclastic blow followed by huge debris and ash? The likelihood of it being a huge magnitude earthquake and not having a volcano blow is pretty low. The USGS has reports that Mt. Rainier is on high priority list for extremely active volcano, and has even seen steam billowing. 

I really hope there's a volcano plan.",2015-09-17T07:09:11+0000,10152943025536199_10152947082401199,10202255960838853,0

Pete Rose didnt compromise the integrity of the game, just himself. And theres a lot of other HoFers who have done worse than bet on a game.

ARod (A-fraud) has shown he is as talented without the drugs as with. He was doing the roids in an era when some speculate half the league was, including pitchers who used roids to heal quicker.

I was the distinguished honor grad and the distinguished leader in my WLC class, recently the NCO of the month, and I also maintain a 3.0 college gpa. I am a single mother that also blogs about life and fitness motivation. I can do all of this because I work hard. I am up at 0430 on the weekends while other soldiers go out and party. I do that because I have bigger goals in life. My daughter has also been able to grow as a little woman and see that women can do whatever they put their minds to.

4251,288818151198_10152846887681199,If the Army wants to continue to change uniforms and what ranks wear what with certain uniforms. All the new stuff should be issued. It gets expensive for Soldiers to have to buy all this new stuff. We already have to stretch every penny. Besides even though it has been published that Soldiers can wear the new uniforms or the existing multi cam uniforms there is still units on JBLM that are not allowing the wear of the uniform until everyone in the unit has them to keep uniformity. However I know when I was a junior enlisted Soldier the one thing that pushed me to buy the new ACU'S at that time was seeing my leadership in the uniform not being told I had to buy it.,2015-07-27T22:56:17+0000,10152846887681199_10152846947316199,879947735362465,25
4252,288818151198_10152846887681199,"OK first I have worn 3 pt uniforms and to be honest they got it right with the black ones. As far as the ACU, it should have never been an army uniform. This will be my 4th. Even though the new one is almost the same, it does have aBDU feel (best uniform ever) but not quite. The ASU is great, but this is the Army I get it leaders are listening to Soldiers. Make a decision  and stick with it. Either way we have to wear it. Most of the soldiers that complain don't even remain in the army and then the career soldier stuck with the changes. Both uniforms will definitely be my last and the clothing allowance does not cover 4 sets like others have said, change it then it should be issued. That is all",2015-07-28T01:09:55+0000,10152846887681199_10152847138861199,10201517266253597,5
4253,288818151198_10152846887681199,"I have seen many comments about the annual clothing allowance. That allowance is not designed nor able to replace an entire issue of uniforms it is given to help offset  the replacement of worn out uniforms or to replace gear a Solider may have lost. And with the serviceability of uniforms being roughly 6 months the allowance is not enough to cover the annual.cost of upkeep on uniforms. Let alone to buy complete issue of new uniforms and to keep in mind thus year isn't just the start for new duty uniforms but pts as well. However we must all understand that is also why the current uniforms where given a wear out date and Soldiers are given time to start buying the new uniforms. But I still believe they should be issued. As I to have seen 3 different pt uniforms and this will be the 3rd design change for the duty uniform as well as my 1 change in the dress uniform. My personal opinion either stop changing uniforms, issue Soldiers the new gear or increase the clothing allowance to help off set the cost a little more.",2015-07-28T16:30:39+0000,10152846887681199_10152848193141199,879947735362465,3

Seems over the past few years my minial ""clothing maintanence"" allowance has went to purchase new, new, and more new issued uniform items the Big Army forces on us while in cahoots with the monopoly known as AAFES and the contractor contracts that make these new items, making them richer and the common Soldier poorer.

4380,288818151198_10152826971606199,"There's a lot of activity on this thread, we're seeing a lot of misunderstandings - particularly re: the nature of a range fire vs. a prescribed fire. 

Prescribed fires take place under controlled conditions, and are planned in a way that utilizes fire patterns and wind conditions to direct smoke away from nearby communities. They are conducted for land management purposes - fuel reduction (to reduce fuel, and therefore risk from future fires) and habitat restoration (reduction of invasive species and to promote germination of native plants that have evolved for a habitat where fire is part of the ecocycle).

The current fire burning on the artillery impact area is not a prescribed fire, it is a range fire.

Range fires are wildfires in the sense that they are not planned - they are set by training activity, ordnance, or sometimes spontaneous ignition in very hot or dry conditions. 

We have an active monitoring program in place, and most range fires are quickly discovered and contained by JBLM's wildland fire crews and fire dept. firefighters. 

That said - range fires on the artillery impact area are a special case.

There are some secondary benefits to range fires on the impact area - like prescribed fires, they reduce the threat of future fires and improve habitat.

*** However, the primary reason for allowing the fires to continue burning (within a safe containment area, and under continued monitoring) is firefighter safety. ***

There is no safe way to send a a fire truck full of firefighters into a fire that may contain dud artillery rounds primed to explode (in fact, there is no safe way to send armored military vehicles into the impact area under those conditions). We can safely allow the fire to continue under continued monitoring, with ample fire breaks in place around the perimeter of the impact area - but we cannot simply go in and put it out.

An artillery impact area fire will typically burn slowly (due to fuel reduction from previous fires) over the course of several weeks. It will die down during cool weather with low winds, reducing to embers as the fuel present is consumed, then regain strength when the wind shifts direction, pushing the fire into a new area with a fresh supply of fuel.

If the fire gains sufficient strength, crews monitoring such fires may consider calling for aerial fire suppression to reduce large flames, - however, without ground-based fire suppression crews to handle remaining areas at the base of the fire, it's unlikely a range fire will be fully extinguished until the weather changes or no fuel remains in the area. And unless large flames are present, aerial suppression would have minimal impact on the smoke being produced by a low, smoldering fire like the current impact area fire.",2015-07-20T17:20:51+0000,10152826971606199_10152832730476199,288818151198,9

There are some benefits to the habitat, as with the prescribed fires, but the primary reason they are allowed to burn until the fuel around them is exhausted is safety, not land management - there is no safe way to send the crews into a field that is potentially full of unexploded artillery rounds while a fire is underway.

4485,288818151198_10152818465841199,"The base is currently working on increasing transportation options on JBLM. Coming up in August, the current shuttle route will go from 9 stops and 70 minute frequency to 20 stops on Lewis North and Main and McChord Field and a transit van coming around every 20 min. This will make it much easier to get around base without your POV. As far as carpools for Service members go: it can be a lot more flexible than you think. 1) You don't have to take it every day. 2) There's an emergency ride home program where you're reimbursed up to 6 times a year for a cab ride home. 3) When we discuss vanpool options with Service members we often recommend carpooling within the same unit if possible. 4) We have a couple of Service member vanpools that have been very successful so far. Lastly, many are unaware of the Mass Transit Benefit program where government employees are eligible for up to $130 to join a vanpool -- for most that's a free ride to work. Keep an eye out on our FB page for updates to all of this! -- GO Lewis McChord Facebook Admin",2015-07-14T23:27:45+0000,10152818465841199_10152820120501199,145481172200710,0
4486,288818151198_10152818465841199,"Let's talk about traffic management instead because that seems to be the elephant in the room. I can drive about this entire base and find 8-10 absolutely pointless stop signs. Or, stop signs that should be yield signs in other cases. Let's put in more traffic circles, like at the T intersection on the North Lewis bypass, just inside the main gate and left at the light. That used to be a straight through I heard, and probably due to high accidents a stop sign was put in making it a 3 way stop which wastes a whole heck of a lot of time. When I used to go to formation on North Fort that used to be backed up halfway to the museum on bad days, and it doesn't seem that anyone is doing anything about it. I'm from Ohio and of course no traffic manager, but I have to say that some places I have lived actually coordinate traffic signals to a certain degree. You want to know why it takes so long to get across base? Not because of a lack of car pools, but because you have to stop at almost every single light. I don't know how many times I have had to stop for a light that changed so quickly that it shouldn't have changed to begin with - and there wasn't even anyone coming from the cross street! Let's do things like turn lights off or to blinking during off-peak hours. Why are there so many green arrows on this base? Why can't you just yield to oncoming traffic before turnng left like anywhere else? Does everyone have to take a turn at almost every light? I don't mean to point fingers here but the traffic management on this base seems to me to be the issue that can be affected immediately.",2015-07-13T23:50:49+0000,10152818465841199_10152818597391199,10204692052835712,24

I live on base, and would gladly ride my bicycle to work, but JBLM roads are horrible, the bike lanes (if they exist) are often lower than the car lanes, so they collect gravel and debris, which is much more dangerous for bicyclists than cars. And I'm currently not riding because I busted an inner-tube, and the PX doesn't even sell 700c inner-tubes. So now I have to drive 20 miles to REI and 20 miles back, before I can ride my bike again.

At Russell Landing, the wading beach and and marina remain open, and fishing and boating activities in those areas are unaffected by the closure at Shoreline.",2015-06-26T20:44:54+0000,10152785294081199_10152786704936199,288818151198,2

5073,288818151198_10152743528136199,"There's a lot of conversation on this thread and we don't want to stifle that - because that's what DoD awareness observances (and this forum) are all about.

However, we would like to take a moment to clear a few things up:

The JBLM Pride Month event is part of a DoD-wide observance of Lesbian, Gay, Transgender and Bisexual Awareness Month, observed in June.

These events are designated by the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity to educate our community and focus our efforts on maintaining a service culture that accepts cultural differences - particularly those of populations that are traditionally under-represented by ethnicity in specific ranks, career fields or occupations - so that we can continue to successfully attract, recruit, develop and retain a highly-skilled Total Force capable of meeting current and future mission requirements.

There are typically about 10 such observances throughout the year This year, one of those observances is Pride Month. (The complete list of 2015 DoD-wide observances is: Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, African American/Black History Month, Women's History Month, Holocaust Remembrance Day/Days of Remembrance, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, LGTB Pride Month, Women's Equality Day, Hispanic Heritage Month, National Disability Employment Awareness Month, and National American Indian Heritage Month).

Observing the accomplishments of a specific population or group does not take anything away from the accomplishments of other groups, it merely helps spotlight the achievements of noteworthy individuals or a historically under-represented group (either across the services, in a specific service, or in specific career areas) in a way that shows our organization's continued commitment and support to promoting diversity in our workforce.

If you are unaware of the contributions past and current LGBT individuals have made to our national defense, this might be a good event for you to attend and expand your knowledge base. It may also be helpful, when living or working with LGTB personnel in the future, to understand some of the specific cultural barriers they, as a group, have historically faced or which some may continue to face in mainstream U.S. culture in order to prevent inadvertent conflicts or miscommunication in your unit or workplace.

On the other hand, this is a voluntary event - like all EO and EEO observances. Attendance is not and has never been mandatory (in fact, it's highly unlikely the McChord Club could contain the entire military, employee, and family member population of JBLM in a three hour period, even if the average person spent only a few seconds each inside the building). We are sharing information about the event for the benefit of those who would like to attend, just as we do other events that take place on the base. You are not required to attend any more than you are required to attend any other event we publicize (if attendance were mandatory, we probably wouldn't bother to publicize it here on Facebook - since you'd be required to show up whether we advertised it, or not).

You are welcome to continue the conversation on this page with other members of our JBLM community. However, we need everyone who comments to make more of an effort to keep their comments in compliance with our comment/moderation policy: no curse words, no racial/ethnic slurs, no personal insults or attacks. You can read the full version - including some examples - here: http://www.facebook.com/notes/joint-base-lewis-mcchord/posting-guidelines/294975491658

JBLM Community - we want to hear what you have to say. But please find ways to say it in a manner that is professional and respectful of others, or we will remove your comments from this page. If there is something you feel you need to say that you cannot post without violating that policy, you can also send it to us via a private message using the ""message"" button on our page, email us at usarmy.jblm.imcom.mbx.pao-public@mail.mil, or use the ICE system (direct comments to the Public Affairs Office or the JBLM Commander's Office).

I would venture to say that they weren't put up to make the lives of the commuting soldier easier. Rather, they are for civilians who regularly travel through the area. This would account for the many and ongoing negative comments on this post. I'm sure the responses to this question would be more positive from those that meters were intended to benefit.

Prior to them helping me I was at a civilian hospital for a week and they told my family to,plan my funeral.. Not Madigan I got transferred back to Madiagn and my Drs and the staff said your not going anywhere but home.. And they saved me.. So please when you say they ""suck"" go to patient advocate and file your complaint they will follow up and try their best to fix the issue.. Also any other hospital you go to will have good and bad.

The roundabout is easy to use, and there are plenty of signs.  It feels pretty awesome  driving over the bridge and seeing the traffic below. The only issue I can forsee,  is the traffic light heading out of Barnes  onto perimeter road. I can see this being a bottleneck,  and getting  backed up. So far  the wait time has been no more than two light iterations. Overall, the entire plan was well conceived,  and executed.  The transition between  McChord and Lewis couldn't be any better.

5741,288818151198_10152665095691199,There are a lot of people that aren't use to the site of bears here. It's a military installation and that brings people from all over the world. I've never seen wild bears and I ride horses on Lewis a lot. The Bears are becoming fearless. Horse back riders are encountering bears here lately and instead of running the bears have actually been coming towards riders. It's their natural habitat though so we are the ones who need to leave them be but if they attack someone they won't avoid doing it again. I do however believe they should have tranquilized but how were they going to determine if it was the same bear?!

Distractions or momentary lapses of attention are human and will never be eliminated. I do way too often see people driving on the phone and I do notice their driving changes from being on the phone. I also agree that I see a lot of MPs on base and non military police off base driving while they are on a hand held phone. I have a hands free Bluetooth system in my car and still try to use my phone as little as possible. ""Practice what you preach."" I only answer calls  that I think are need to know now calls and keep them as short as possible and will often pull off the road for a more involved conversation.

As for pets, I fear drivers with dogs in laps more than anything. In the last two weeks I almost got hit by people driving with dogs in their laps at least two times. The one guy actually had a dog running back and forth across his lap and the passenger seat while another dog was laying around his neck on his shoulders. How is that not dangerous or distracting?

""Barnes gate open until 9 pm instead of 7 pm...or keep open 24 hrs.""

Exchange and Commissary doesn't close until 8 to 8:30 pm at night. This would allow people that live to the East/South of McChord to exit the base without having to drive all the way around from the Main gate. If kept open 24 hrs, it would also allow people access to Madigan and JBLM-Main from the East as well without having to drive completely around the base.

6580,288818151198_10152566137381199,"While military service is selfless in nature, America undoubtedly believes they should be compensated for what they do. My greatest fear however is not the compensation my wife receives, but what the compensation will look like for our E3 in the year 2020(the state of Washington will be at $12 by 2018). If their pay and compensation resembles that of America's minimum wage workers, we may find ourselves falling short of recruiting the best America has to offer. 

And not only would the value of our E3 be decreased if minimum wage goes up without similar increases to that E3's basic pay/BAH/BAS, then the General's of 2020 would also lose their ""value"" without a similar increase as the E3 should get. And let us not forget that the General's of 2020 are the Colonel's of today, the Captains of 2008 and the Lieutenant's of 2001 when our country sent them to war. If we fail to prepare for tomorrow, we will repeat history back to a time when SMA Dailey was one of those undervalued by America but joined anyway. And I doubt they make them like him too often.

6688,288818151198_10152549848391199,"I think that in the last few years there's been a positive shift towards serious storytelling that does a better job of telling military stories than the movies.

Movies depicting the U.S. military that immediately come to mind: The Hurt Locker, Fort Bliss, Iron Man, Transformers, Blackhawk Down, No Easy Day, Monuments Men, Tropic Thunder (sort of), Jarhead, and In the Valley of Elah. Are these better/worse than their predecessors: Top Gun, GI Jane, A Few Good Men, Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, The Hunt for Red October, Apocalypse Now, Good Morning Vietnam, Rambo, The Dirty Dozen, The Great Escape, etc. and so on...? It's hard to say.

Some of these movies are escapist fantasy, some are comedy, some are drama. Some are meticulously produced under the close watch of expert technical advisers, some are low-budget indie films with limited budgets that introduce anachronisms left and right, but still manage to tell a great story.

I think we tend to remember the best examples in all of these genres, and forget the lesser ones, so I think the ""classics"" always have the edge on quality compared to more recent examples in our memories.

That doesn't mean every movie gets it right, but, I think most filmmakers are doing a better job than they usually get credit for.",2015-03-03T00:51:30+0000,10152549848391199_10152550052346199,10202462607445728,0

The reason JBLM PAO has a comment policy is to establish reasonable standards of conduct. I don't have the resources or the authority to investigate the veracity of every comment one of our 37000 fans might make against any other individual who might or might not have a connection to the base on a daily basis - so the policy is, if you don't have something nice to say, at least refrain from calling anyone out by name. It's possible that someone making such a comment might have a legitimate grievance. It's also possible that the person making the complaint has malicious intent. Since I'm not in a position to make that evaluation, the policy is such comments are not allowed to remain on the page. Understand that the policy, and enforcement of that policy, is not a comment on the  allegation - it's a comment on my inability to serve as the ""truth police"" in an incident that, as JBLM's social media manager, I have neither the resources nor the authority to investigate. The IG does have those resources, and I would again refer you to them if you have claims or credible evidence re: your complaint to share.

7272,288818151198_10152472300491199,"A couple of frequently asked questions about the JBLM Shuttle service:

Why doesn't the shuttle stop in family housing neighborhoods?

Federal transportation regulations don't allow the government to provide transportation from home to workplace. That's why the shuttle routes and service schedule is designed to support duty day appointments for single service members who don't have their own vehicles, although others can use the service on a space available basis.

Why doesn't the JBLM Shuttle operate on McChord Field?

When it launched, the JBLM Shuttle included a McChord Field route, but a smaller customer service footprint at McChord Field made shuttle service less necessary (since most customer services are within walking distance of service member duty locations). After a trial period, the route was discontinued due to low ridership.

What does it cost the government to operate the shuttle?

The shuttle operates using borrowed military manpower from units at JBLM. Vehicle expenses are paid through funds raised by the Qualified Recycling Program.",2015-01-21T16:52:43+0000,10152472300491199_10152472309921199,288818151198,3

7647,288818151198_10152389434021199,"Danny Glover has been in some nice movies but don't forget he is a Leftist supporter in real life see for your self. Film and television star
Supporter of the Castro dictatorship in Cuba
Supporter of Not In Our Name, a Maoist-created antiwar movement 
Depicts America as ?one of the main purveyors of violence in this world?

Danny Glover is a film and television actor as well as a leftist ideologue who has ardently supported the dictatorial regimes of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Cuba's Fidel Castro.

Glover was born in San Francisco, California in 1947. His parents both worked for the U.S. Postal Service and were active members of the NAACP.

Glover graduated from George Washington High School in San Francisco. He briefly attended American University in Washington, DC and then transferred to San Francisco State College (SFSC), where he met Asake Bomani, whom he would marry in 1975.

At SFSC, Glover joined the Black Students Union (BSU), which staged a five-month-long strike that ultimately pressured the school into establishing its first Ethnic Studies Department. Glover recounts how his BSU membership led him into radical politics:

?A number of us in the Black Students Union ... worked in the [Black] Panthers' free-breakfast-for-children program. We also helped them organize their newspaper. Although we weren't in the party, we were all involved. I lived in a political commune for a year. We embraced a lot of struggles globally. The anti-Vietnam War movement positioned us. There were liberation struggles going on in South Africa, the Portuguese colonies, and Zimbabwe. All of those things converged into a very strong activism.?

Following his graduation from SFSC in 1971, Glover enrolled in the American Conservatory Theater's Black Actors Workshop, which exposed him to the works of South African playwright Athol Fugard. Glover would later star in the 1982 Broadway production of Fugard's Master Harold ... and the Boys, which brought him critical acclaim.

Glover made his film debut in Escape from Alcatraz in 1979. He went on to play supporting roles in such films as The Color Purple (1985); Mandela (1987); A Raisin in the Sun (1989); A Rage in Harlem (1991); How Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001). Glover is most familiar to moviegoers as Mel Gibson?s partner, Roger Murtaugh, in the four Lethal Weapon films. Glover also has produced a number of movies, most of which which feature racial themes. These include Buffalo Soldiers (1997), which was about an all-black cavalry unit in the post-Civil War era, and Freedom Song (2000), about the U.S. civil rights movement.

Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, Glover publicly stated that the U.S. was in no position to pass moral judgment on the terrorists responsible for those atrocities. ?One of the main purveyors of violence in this world,? said Glover, ?has been this country, whether it's been against Nicaragua, Vietnam or wherever.?

On another occasion, Glover criticized Americans' ?rabid [post-9/11] nationalism that has its own kind of potential of being maniacal, in some sense.?

Characterizing President George W. Bush as a racist who would gladly turn back the clock on America's post-1950s civil rights advances, Glover has said, ?We must stand vigilant against Bush in these times and work with the abolitionists.?

At a February 2003 anti-war rally in New York City, Glover charged that the Bush administration was composed of ?liars and murderers.?

Glover was a signatory to ?The Conscience of the World,? a public letter (signed by 160 artists and performers) which condemned the War in Iraq and pledged support for Fidel Castro's Communist dictatorship in Cuba. Glover and Castro are close personal friends. According to the state-controlled Cuban newspaper Granma International, ?There?s an intense relationship between Danny Glover and Havana. It was love at first sight, and not only has it stood the test of his frequent visits, but it is growing deeper and deeper, through discoveries and affinities.?

Glover also supports Not In Our Name, the Revolutionary Communist Party movement which ?pledges resistance to [America's] endless war, detentions and roundups, [and] attacks on civil liberties.?

Glover is a strong backer of the socialist magazine Monthly Review, which he says ?challenges us to think, inspires us to action, and makes us realize that the impossible is only difficult, not insurmountable.?

On several occasions, Glover has visited Venezuela and made guest appearances on President Hugo Chavez's television and radio talk show, Hello, President. Glover is a Board member of Venezuela's ?TeleSUR? news network, which Chavez created in 2005.",2014-12-21T05:33:39+0000,10152389434021199_10152392562961199,10152374012601856,2

What kind of Mother drags her kids out in the rain and haven't had breakfast at 5 a.m. just to save a few bucks??",2014-11-29T01:00:32+0000,10152349648136199_10152349971991199,10204094414539721,3

Push the opening times back to 5 or 6am and just extend some sales longer. And people please, just chill.",2014-11-28T21:10:31+0000,10152349648136199_10152349695461199,10203200553560037,3

I was in retail management for 15 years, and I'll tell you this, a lot of retailers inflate the original price before marking it down. Fred Meyer is one of them. 
My advice, know the regular retail price of an item well in advance of the holidays. That is the only way you'll know for sure if it's a true sale price.
Also, a TV or toy may be on sale at a great price, but they may have limited quantities at each store, and if that's the case, you can bet that the employees are getting first crack at it, leaving you empty handed!
Best advice, start your shopping earlier in the year, and save yourself from the stress There are always great sales.",2014-11-28T23:29:29+0000,10152349648136199_10152349868506199,583196598452282,2

Awards are like candy and nowadays you get an award for just about anything. and most importantly, no matter what anybody says, no matter what some CSM or commander says, awards are based on RANK. I propose two things: 1.The DA 638, Award Recommendation, should not have a field for rank. Before the reviewer even reads the recommendation they see the rank, and the type of award. That is when they make their decision. 2. Award recommendations should be reviewed outside the unit/chain of command. This allows a full consideration of the Soldier's achievements and the Soldier's rank will not be a factor, and the Soldier's unit/chain of command cannot push forth their own opinion on whether the Soldier deserves it or not just because they know him/her. I don't care to recieve awards anymore. I would rather my Solders recieve awards for their hard work and not be judged by their chain of command and their rank.",2014-11-17T19:59:20+0000,10152326969481199_10152331569731199,831704903527600,17

I was the senior instructor at Fort Benning teaching the Stryker Master Trainer and Stryker Leaders Courses for three years.  On my own time (6 months), I developed the new Stryker Master Gunner Course to emplace more emphasis on the mastery skill set of the job title master trainer. I was at the company,  battalion, and brigade recommended for the MSM.  Once it made it to the next level, it was automatically down graded with no questions asked.  I spent three years teaching Stryker master trainer and developed a more rigorous course that was blessed off by the TRADOC commander. (I was an E6 at this time) My brigade and below recognized my hard work and dedication, but was not at a higher echelon.  I know I dragged this on a bit, but my point is how are leaders supposed to have motivated soldiers if their hard work is not recognized or rewarded.  Every unit I've been in had a rank structure process of giving out awards.  It shouldn't be that way,  if the soldier had truly earned it,  why not allow him to get it.",2014-11-17T21:10:59+0000,10152326969481199_10152331699851199,612142612231172,10

Awards are meant to be given dependent on if you deserve them for your actions, not because you're an E-7 or CPT. It is very frustrating to see people who have done less than many other soldiers being given awards with more merit.

8192,288818151198_10152308723321199,"For those who asked if flu shot administrators are required to wear protective gloves:

According to our colleagues at Madigan Army Medical Center - ""Per the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) regulations 29 CFR 1910.1030 'Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens' gloves are not necessary when administering routine injections (like the influenza vaccine) as long as contact with blood or other potentially infectious material is not anticipated. Our staff is fully trained on administering the vaccine in a safe environment, which includes hand sanitation before and after giving the shot/mist to a patient. Our staff can wear gloves if they choose (at which time, they will don new gloves for each new patient) but everyone will hand sanitize before/after the patient receives the vaccine.""

Hope that helps clear things up!",2014-11-04T01:10:34+0000,10152308723321199_10152308772566199,288818151198,2
8193,288818151198_10152308723321199,"I watched several people get flu shots today (at Madigan) by people who did not wash or sanitize their hands in between patients. This is NOT sanitary. Even when I received my shot by our unit medics at our unit building, nobody washed or sanitized their hands in between patients. With all of the disease, germs, and Ebola going around I think we should use common sense and wear a new pair of gloves with every patient. Last time I checked when you jab a needle into someone's arm they bleed. Well, at least I did.

Lastly, who cares what your OSHA regulations say. We always tell our troops you can add to but not take away from regulation so how about we take it one step further and make it an internal requirement that a new pair of gloves are required for every new patient when administering vaccines. Sure you'll have to buy more gloves but if patient safety is number one, then spending more money on safety gear shouldn't be an issue.",2014-11-04T05:04:42+0000,10152308723321199_10152309005556199,831704903527600,3

8382,288818151198_10152283730446199,"My son and two of his Army buddies have been turned down from employment because they are vets.
The reasons given are skills don't appear to be transferable and fear of PTSD.
They've been out (between the three of them) 2-4 years.
It's disheartening to hear the stories from job interviews they've had and what the interviewers say to them.
They do have PTSD and they are struggling to adapt to civilian life. Their experiences have not been positive.
We've been supporting my son financially when he needs it.
My husband is also active duty and will retire in 2-5 years. We are very worried about how the job market will be at that time, and if he'll have the same difficulties as my son.
As for myself, I've not worked since 2009. We've PCSd four times in under eight years. Employers look at all of the places we lived in a short amount of time and don't want to spend the money to hire and train someone that will be leaving soon. Then, add the fact that the job market is horrible. I've given up looking for a job. I am one of those that have dropped out of the job market. We've cut back on alot of our expenses and do without in preparation for retirement.
We are staying debt free. We know an officer that has alot of debt/payments and if he doesn't get picked up for the next promotion, he'll be booted out. He'll have 20 years and will retire, but he'll still have all of that debt, and with the job market the way it is, we are concerned about how he'll do. 

Also, I've heard stories of commanders not allowing soldiers to attend ACAP. It happens more often than you realize. That's being selfish!! They are setting that soldier up for failure and putting their own needs first. Whatever happened to taking care of your soldiers first!?

Do they talk about being debt free in ACAP?
Do they give a list of vet friendly employers?
Are spouses included in ACAP?

9163,288818151198_10152161845041199,"In response to your questions:

Q) Why are participants required to be male to donate plasma for this project?
A) Females are not allowed to donate plasma for this project because the U.S. is partnering with international partners whose protocols prohibit female donation of plasma products. Females may develop certain antibodies in response to previous pregnancies that can trigger a respiratory reaction called TRALI in plasma recipients (U.S. blood banks don't typically have this restriction because they typically screen individual female donors for the antibodies in question - but for the purpose of this pilot project, the U.S. is adhering the partner nation's protocols).

Q) Why are only some blood types being requested?
A) Types A, B, AB blood are needed because the lab needs plasma with specific antibodies present in these blood types. Unlike whole blood, for which Type O is a universal donor, Type O blood's ability to ""get along"" with other blood types actually makes it the least suited for creating plasma products (which are used to prompt clotting). However, type O whole blood is incredibly valuable in hospital settings, and the Armed Services Blood Bank Center - Pacific Northwest encourages anyone who is eligible to make whole blood donations to do so regularly - you can find a blood drive or make an appointment on their website.

Q) Why is there a minimum weight requirement for participants to donate?
A) Plasma donors are required to weigh 175 lbs or more because total blood volume is affected by body size - people who have more blood plasma circulating in their bodies can donate more plasma per donation.",2014-08-20T19:30:25+0000,10152161845041199_10152163169631199,288818151198,0

You train soldiers how to use weapons and then don't let them have one to protect themselves or their families? That makes no sense to me.

It's easy to take classified information out of all place on JBLM because random inspections are not being done on bags. Phone detection systems are not in place to detect phones from entering into classified areas. 4. PT hours is an easy opportunity for a terrorist to hold someone hostage and go through the gate. 5. I walked off base during a road march before an didn't realize it. It was on north fort. Good spot for someone to sneak on with a vehicle. I haven't gone back to see if it was fixed. 6.

I had excellent care when I had my son 4 years ago and authorized to go off post to a civilian doctor.  Then this time around I was forced to go to Madigan for my OB care using prime.  I saw a different provider every appt and not my actual assigned provider, had to re answer numerous questions in my personal health history, and when I had questions about my care, health, and lab work I never received straightforward answers and I wasn't allowed to see my lab results.  Real patient care is seeing the same provider every time and having a comfortable open dialogue with them so care can be at it's optimal best.  That can't happen when the person you see is a different doctor every visit and doesn't have a clue to who you are.",2014-07-10T03:05:12+0000,10152087379411199_10152087460621199,10152762588277004,3

When your patients are having to call every day for weeks at a time to attempt to schedule appointments for themselves or their children, or are being told that a potential illness in their child will either have to wait or be seen at the ER, it's a problem. Madigan, unfortunately, is over run with patients and understaffed. They can't keep up. Clinics are full, appointments are booked for months on end and the ER is bombarded with patients who could have otherwise been seen at a regular clinic had an appointment been made available. Take care of the patients you've got before focusing on caring for more. Madigan has the potential to have an excellent standard of care across the board.

If you want to it to be equal across the board then it should be equal on everything right?  I believe if a woman would like to be in a job that was previously limited to males only, then she should be expected to perform equal to that of her male counterparts.  Women aren't drafted, but that does not mean that women aren't going to war.  The draft has not been used since 1973 when it became All Voluntary, but that has not stopped women from joining the military.  When you are drafted or women stop serving, then you can complain about a draft.  Until then that point is invalid.  I'm sure that if it came down to drafts again, policies would change and I am sure there would be plenty of females volunteering to do their part.  There a specific guidelines in place because of body structures, muscle mass compositions and other factors.  If women cannot pull their weight in the MOS they want to be in, then by all means they shouldn't be there, but that is the same for all sexes.  I personally, would not want a combat arms MOS, but more power to the woman who can physically do it that same as a male and can put up with the controversy and constant proving themselves that is going to come with it.",2014-07-01T02:32:12+0000,10152069847406199_10152071694536199,10203112154260985,0

I was seen by Internal Med there myself and hated them. Finally got switched over to McChord Family Med and have been the happiest I've ever been there. They are wonderful.We started out at McChord and I was transferred to Internal Med upon husband's retirement, without asking. Worst placement ever. However, both our kids use peds and we've had nothing but amazing care there. Son uses Developmental and they are AWESOME. Madigan's craniofacial team is horribly inadequate to care for our son's extensive craniofacial issues, so we go to Children's for his care. Thank God for them. The craniofacial team at Madigan doesn't even have a dental panel on their team. What kind of craniofacial team is that???? Doesn't even do our kids justice for quality care, in that aspect. Sorry. Just being factual. Most patients with craniofacial care require years of dental treatment.

Everyone in town packs the streets with their children to get candy and see the festivities. During the afternoon and evening, there is so much going on in the park. There are carnival style rides, food and drink vendors, the firefighter games, live music and so much fun and sun. Then, at dusk, the fire department lights the fireworks that go up over the lake.

Our JBLM SAFETY message this morning was posted to advise the JBLM community to avoid downtown Seattle or Portland ONLY on Thursday May 1 due to May Day demonstrations that are likely to occur there. 
Please understand, Seattle and Portland are wonderful cities and we have great ties to these communities. However, for the past few years May Day demonstrations there have resulted in significant property damage and injuries to people, even bystanders. 
Our primary concern is for our service members and their families to be safe; therefore, we recommend avoiding these downtowns May 1. 
It?s prudent to give this note of concern and caution.

So why don't you take your ill informed bias back to the side who are willing to watch our soldiers gunned down.

10832,288818151198_10151934767061199,"1) I-5 exits are designed wrong, short exit ramps that end at an intersection with a traffic light with the volume of traffic that is getting off at that exit is asking for nothing but overflow on the highway. Exits at gates should be cloverleafs so the intersections are eliminated at both ends of the bridges outside of gates that cause backups at the gates when leaving in the afternoon and on I-5 in the mornings when traffic from exits ramps backup on I-5. I know the main gate for the most part already addresses this but all the gates need this.

2) People don't seem to be able to handle traffic getting on and off at exit ramps. It just seems like too many here panic when they get to areas with lots of ramps and slowdown for no other reason than an inability to merge and drive. This problem may not be able to be fixed but service lanes reducing the amount of ramps directly on I-5 may ease that.

3) The automated card scanning system does not work. It slows the process down because the gates are slower than a human looking at the IDs and waving you on. 

4) Possibly moving the gates farther in base property to allow more room for backups at gates to not interfere with civilian traffic outside of gates. McChord's gates seem to do a good job of this but Lewis's gates are backed up into civilian roadways almost every weekday. 

5) Bypass lanes for Tacoma/JBLM for traffic coming from Seattle heading further out than DuPont. This would eliminate this traffic from localized traffic and reduce backups caused by others jockeying for exits ramps. No lane changes allowed once you entered this roadway with a 55 MPH minimum speed 60 MPH maximum speed photo radar enforced. This will never happen because it will always be claimed to be too expensive but is probably the only true way of making any positive move in fixing traffic problems.",2014-04-17T14:51:20+0000,10151934767061199_10434996,10204152342755738,1

The main and LARGE huge injustice that's being done is the fact that CURRENT enlisted personelle will NOT be grandfathered in under the ""tattoo"" policy regarding officers. Some of these enlisted soldiers have waited 10 years scraping their way through in order to qualify and further their career as an officer or warrant officer. It's a kick in the teeth to our enlisted men who joined hoping to further their career in the future. Now they're being given the choice to stay in the suck as an enlisted soldier for 20 years or pay to have laser removal surgery of their tattoo which takes takes forever and is expensive. 4 lower arm tattoos are authorized but sleeves arent?!?!?!

I finished college and high school with a 4.0, and my husband is currently attending college with a 3.8. He has only had extremely positive NCOers and all of his leadership really like him.

As for the effect on Airman, and soldiers, it is not good, retirements are in jeopardy,  not to mention our way of life.

Colors casing ceremonies for routine deployments of conventional units to Afghanistan are open to the public, and frequently covered by news media.

We don't post - and don't allow others to post - detailed information re: planned unit movements associated with the deployment on this page. As stated in our moderation policy, we do monitor comments and would remove any comments containing OPSEC information (heads up: there's also a profanity filter).

I would encourage all service members and their families to review this briefing on OPSEC & Social Media: http://www.slideshare.net/USArmySocialMedia/social-media-roundup-opsec-and-safe-social-networking

For deployed or deploying service members and families, this briefing also contains some excellent information about protecting OPSEC during your social media activities: http://www.slideshare.net/USArmySocialMedia/social-media-roundup-6-social-media-considerations-for-deployed-soldiers-and-their-families

The counters were damaged and a horrible baby blue color. We have enough rooms for everyone. I like the 2 closets in the ""master"". Our house that we owned before the military didn't have a coat closet, so excited for that. 
We've had to pay the electric bill which was crap. The bill didn't even show the margin that we should have been in. The company charges an extra fee because you ran over and then an extra fee to pay with a card. We have 3 of our heaters off at ALL times and don't use any lights until 3pm or later. I think the bill was meant for someone else. We have mold constantly in the bathroom. Anyone else? A maintenance man came out and told me the vent doesn't work so always leave the door or window open.

She brought us together last year and 6 has grown to 40+. We have many wife night outs, family barbecues and other events. This group is where rank doesn't matter.

My wife worked in HR at a large retail store in Lakewood, and you wouldn't believe the amount of SMs who would only bring a copy of a DD214 and not a resume.  That doesn't cut it in the civilian world.  Begin to think of a job that correlates with your military experience, and keep an eye out for military friendly employers.  Military Service alone will not warrant you a job, you still need to compete with other applicants and prove that they should hire you.  Go to the ACAP job fairs, meet employers, and network as much as possible.  Undersand that most available jobs will be entry-level, and adjust your lifestyle to fit that.

It isn't much, but it provided my family with some income for a few weeks until I completed all the interviews and background checks for my current job.  I believe they were paying me $415 a week, which is pretty terrible, but better than not having any income.  Every service member is eligible for Unemployment, you can apply online and never have to set foot in their office.  All they need is a fax of your DD214 and I believe your final LES.  Check the website.  Like I said in my post yesterday, your lifestyle will have to become very flexible in order to find success once you get out.

11574,288818151198_10200817684803690,"The ""D"" in PTSD should stand for ""Damage"" and not ""Disorder.""
Stress has been shown to damage vital parts of the brain which influence cognitive ability, proper chemical & electrical functioning levels in the body, and destabilize our genes. This neurological damage is the basis for the symptoms. By continuously look at it as a disorder; it is justified to not look at the root cause and therefore extend treatments which don?t work. This type of thinking turns it into a lifelong disability which only profits the mental health industry and the pharmaceutical companies. This puts a strain on our communities and our healthcare system. 
By looking at it as damage, we can begin to understand that it can be fixed. Neuroplasticity is real. We have the capability to regrow neural networks in our brain. New brain imaging and mapping methods have reinforced this fact. The trick now is finding which methods are the most effective, longest lasting, and most cost-effective.",2014-02-26T16:03:24+0000,10200817684803690_4909394,10203532739588740,1
11575,288818151198_10200817684803690,"Post-traumatic stress is normal.  If it becomes excessive and/or it is not dealt with properly, it can become a disorder.  Every individual has different breaking points for different stressors.  A culture that discourages stress relief and treatment only begs for trouble.  How many times do we still hear of individuals being told to ""tough it up"" or ""quit being a baby"" or make sacrifices for the team?  We all want to pull our weight and still fear being stigmatized when you honestly report stress.

If you want the best results, hold commanders accountable.  Just as they are accountable if there is a culture of racism, theft, harassment, hazing or other forms of bullying in their commands, then they should also be held accountable when PTSD occurs due to denying proper treatment.  The commander to be held accountable can be anywhere from individuals, through NCO's, SNCO's, all officers and even civilian leaders.  Far too often, it's the colonels who should know better.  They might acknowledge official orders, but make it known that he or she won't obey, nor should any suffering member get special treatment.

Rules don't make situations better, enforcement does.

Most of us are in commands where they already take care of their folks.  It's a good feeling, especially being at one command where constant bullying by one person was not dealt with despite constant complaints.  Many careers were ruined, and in my case, was told that ""they"" were surprised I hadn't gone crazy.  What?  I guess I am one of the lucky resilient folks.  I've been tested for depression and PTSD, but don't come close.  But what about those who did cross that line too often, only to finally break?  Are they getting the help they need?  Do they get a VA disability rating?  Can they even hold a normal job?

I am reminded of the main character in a The Hurt Locker.  After his EOD tour, with all kinds of stress, we see him standing in a grocery store, bewildered at all the choices.  We also see him suffering with his personal relationships and coping in general.  He's only happy when he gets another deployment.  This made me sad, because although no mention of ""PTS"" was mentioned, you see it and understand it.  How many more deployments before unmanaged stress becomes a Disorder, which is what we need to avoid?",2014-02-25T18:24:43+0000,10200817684803690_4906819,942488042430764,1

11589,288818151198_10200801868088282,"These lanes are such a terrible idea. They are not wide enough for 80% of the vehicles on the roadway to be parked & have a vehicle pass them (even slowly). The narrow 2 lanes on Pendleton make it very difficult to pass if there is a broken down car or police trying to get by. The entrance to get into these lanes is extremely narrow & the exit is confusing (most have no left turn). Then they changed the name of the street from Pendleton Road to Pendleton BLVD. But only in the new construction area. So now 1 street has several names: Jackson, Pendleton Rd, Pendleton BLVD, Main St, Vancouver, and ends as 8th St. While these lanes may look fancy and new, the actual functionality of them is pretty poor.",2014-02-21T19:47:34+0000,10200801868088282_4896074,10152392756151318,9

Additionally, no right turn lane from 41st DIV onto Pendleton... Did they do a traffic study before approving this plan? I feel like this was a beautification project that lacks any functionality. Also, the current project that just started on Liggett... A brand new 100-200m stretch of sidewalk that was finished roughly 6 or so months ago just got ripped up when this project started.

A one way center street that goes into post in the am and then changes to off post in the pm would of been a better use of that extra lane. Also the traffic light at 12th street turning left when going south, is stuck on red. I sat for three cycles of the light changes before I could get over and had to go up and around the block instead. This was another great example of building something pretty but useless in function.

12095,288818151198_10151729846256199,"There is no need for the Roy gate to be opened, it is permanently closed, the east gate is the route to take to get to 507 that goes through yelm coming off post on the east side.  Nisqually gate routes up onto Mounts Rd which can take you down into the reservation in the Nisqually basin,  but drivers would need to know where to turn to redirect back to I5, it's a two lane road and those who know the route can attest that even with hardly any freeway traffic this route is a slow go.  What needs to be done is for the WADOT to put in a business route similar to 405, maybe an expansion of 507 and finish the cross base hwy that was unfunded during the swing of the recession.  Population has exploded in the southend and is only getting worse, but the hwy system has not been updated south of Tacoma to support the additional traffic, nor had the transit system kept up with demand for better service.  We will continue to see traffic snarls whether it be a normal traffic commute or severe accident.  It's been like this for years.  I know I have lived here since 89, it's just gotten progressively worse each year.  They are talking expansion of the I5 corridor around JBLM, but they need another alternative aside from just I5 that can support heavy traffic.  There is no quick fix.  Just let's all be thankful to not have been the victim in today's accident and have some compassion, you don't know that the victim's family isn't reading this thread so take a minute and just grasp that a life was lost today.",2013-12-17T06:15:55+0000,10151729846256199_27219440,10152383383119776,6

12380,288818151198_10151680163936199,"Frequently Asked Questions:

*Is this an actual emergency?*
No, this is a monthly communications test. No further action is required. In the event of an actual emergency, we would provide additional information in the body of the message.

*Why do you do this test?*
The test message is part of a base-wide monthly communication test. The test message confirms our ability to communicate using this platform.

*Do I need to acknowledge I received this message?""
No - the test message is merely confirmation that we are able to distribute information, if needed. No action/confirmation is required.

*Do you really think Facebook is best way to alert people to an emergency situation?*
Facebook is just one of the many communication tools JBLM would employ to distribute important information to members of our community during and after an emergency situation. An engaged community that shares important info via social media can help emergency management officials reach far more people than relying on Emergency Alert Systems, alone. For members of the JBLM community, we also suggest signing up for Pierce County & JBLM alerts via phone, text, and email at https://member.everbridge.net/index/453003085611338.

*This alert went out yesterday, and I didn't see in on my newsfeed until today!*
Sharing information via multiple sources increases the odds that you will get the information in a timely manner, but no communication method can guarantee that all potentially affected parties will be contacted. In the event of an emergency, our expectation is we will use every available means to reach as many potentially affected people as possible.

*I live out of state. Why is this even in my newsfeed, and what could I possibly do with this information if this was an actual emergency?*
If the info is in your newsfeed, you probably ""liked"" the JBLM Facebook page at some point in time - possibly because you know someone at or have an interest in activities at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. If the information doesn't apply to you, you may disregard it. If you have a friend or loved one here, we hope information we share would help provide information about the evolving emergency, answer questions, and possibly help alleviate concerns until you can re-establish direct communication with your family or friends - and that you would consider sharing the info with those who might benefit.",2013-11-20T21:31:09+0000,10151680163936199_26915303,288818151198,8

The fixes would take time and cost money but I think they need to build service roads along the side of I-5 the full length of JBLM. They also need to change the exits to the over passes that exit to gates to clover leafs instead of traffic controlled intersections. This would almost totally eliminate backups at the gates. Any direct cross over bridges that could be built to connect both sides of the base would be a bonus but they should stay inside the confines of the base so they don't alter the surrounding communities with massive changes in traffic flow through side roads. The combination of these changes together should help stop that from happening as people would take the most direct route to their destination which for most would only be the side roads in these communities if they actually live in these communities. So there would be little to no new traffic added to places like DuPont. I-5 changes should be completed first also so there is no temporary increase while the I-5 changes are happening.,2013-10-29T01:46:08+0000,10151629619246199_9248822,10204152342755738,1

If half the units report for duty at 0630 and others at 0730 (with 1630 & 1730 releases) we won't have this problem. As most brigades have their own internal assets; i.e., finance, DFAC, etc, there should be no hardship to meal card holders or married soldiers.

12605,288818151198_10151607299001199,"Frequently Asked Questions:

*Where can I take the survey?*
http://www.keysurvey.com/votingmodule/s180/f/543911/10fc/

*Who can take the survey?*
The survey is open to households of all service members stationed at JBLM (Active Duty & National Guard/Reservists), and DoD employees. Service members, employees, or military spouses can fill out the survey - but to preserve the quality of the data, please limit responses to one per household.

*What's in it for me?*
The survey is very short - just 40 questions! But as an extra incentive, our community partners are offering gift cards for randomly selected respondents.

*Gift cards? That sounds fishy. How do I know this isn't a scam?*
It's not a scam. The information collected will help JBLM and area community partners develop transportation, housing, dining, shopping and recreational opportunities that better support the needs and preferences of our service members and their families. You can learn more about the SSMCP & how information collected from previous surveys is being used at http://www.jblm-growth.com/

*If this is a government survey, why isn't this being hosted on a non- .mil site?*
The survey is being coordinated by the partnership, not JBLM exclusively, which means it's not a ""government survey."" However, JBLM is a member of the partnership, and the military community directly benefits from the information gathered - which is why we're encouraging all eligible members of the JBLM community to participate.

*I heard this survey will download a virus onto my computer!*
If your browser's security settings are set to the most restrictive settings (for example, if you are viewing the site from most government computers), you may have trouble viewing certain types of content - such as the YouTube video embedded on the first page of the survey. You can take the survey without viewing the video, or use a different computer - but the security of the survey website has been verified by the JBLM NEC, and is safe for you to view.

*Will my personal information be collected?*
Participation is voluntary, and responses are anonymous. Information collected will help JBLM and area community partners develop transportation, housing, dining, shopping and recreational opportunities that better support the needs and preferences of our service members and their families.

Thanks for participating in this important effort to improve the lives of our military service members and their families!",2013-10-16T18:25:21+0000,10151607299001199_26523280,288818151198,0

Also if the military is going to make exceptions for him why have they not made exceptions for Jewish rabbis who would like to join?

12670,288818151198_10151595243136199,"I was going to include the entire section of AR 600-20, chapter 5, paragraph 5-6 (Accomodating Religious Practices), but some would not read the entire thing and miss this very key part:

(g) The Army does not accommodate exceptions to personal grooming standards for religious reasons except as
noted below:
1. Grooming practices based in religious reasons will not be singled out for special accommodation, restriction, or
prohibition. The grooming standards contained in AR 670?1 will apply equally to religious and non-religious grooming practices.
2. As an exception to this policy, religious-based exceptions to policy previously given Soldiers under the provisions of this regulation prior to 1 January 1986 continue in effect as long as the affected Soldiers remain otherwise qualified.

This portion of that regulation is what gives the DCS (deputy chief of staff) of Army G-1, the authority to grant waivers for Soldiers such as CPL Lamba, and the two Sikh Captains who came before him that serve in our ranks.  And to the gentleman that had a comment about my ""lack of basic understanding of military culture""....read up on Regulations and you'll see there is most times an exception to policy somewhere that only requires the person seek that exception.  Also, I'm an Equal Opportunity Advisor (A Senior Staff position at brigade level and above), so its my job to know these things for the Army, but for the Air Force which I see you are a member of, and a new member from what I can tell, please refer to your services regulation for each one is often somewhat different.

We recognize that national and local media have run a series of stories announcing an end to DOD furlough in conjunction with the 1 OCT Gov't shutdown. Although the Department of the Army and MEDCOM have issued updated guidance over the weekend that expands on the previous definition of excepted activities, IT DOES NOT AFFECT all currently furloughed employees.   

Currently furloughed employees will remained furloughed unless told directly by their supervisor to report back to work.

Under normal circumstances, it makes sense that the PAO office could run this feedback right away through to the appropriate departments who may or may not take action. But given that most of those departments are operating now with minimal manning, to include the PAO, it doesn't work so well. Also, generally there is a group of Soldiers tasked to the CSM to generally do whatever comes up, but it is very possible they are already working something.

Assuming you have the money for your trip, your actual PCS should not be affected. When you arrive JBLM you will sign in at Waller Hall (post) and your receiving brigade. You will be able to inprocess some but not all agencies. Housing is Equity Residdential, and they are private and not affected by the shutdown. Finance is managed mostly by civilians, but emergency pay issues can be handled by green suiters either in the finance office or by commanders and first sergeants in the units. Settling travel pay issues will be slowed significantly. It already is backlogged from last summer's furlough, plus there are always delays Sept-October as they wait for the new FY money to come in. Add this latest wrinkle, and you can expect settlement to take 8-12 weeks. If you need money sooner, you can request it through the finance office. There will be some folks available to work these issues, but it will be hard to get their time. Lots of other folks will have similar issues. If you run into financial issues go immediately to your unit and ask for support. Your commander and first sergeant have the latest and greatest information.",2013-10-02T02:36:58+0000,10151582606916199_26362899,10203385115164782,3

You need to look not only at shelf price, but consider the per unit price, and the surcharge at the commissary v the tax (if applicable) in town. And I also suggest that you consider turning down using the baggers. I have stopped using them at our commissary when I am there. They are barely more than slave labor working for tips only.

I hate this idea because I have always enjoyed the quality of products at can't beat pricing, even after 5% service fee and $5 tip for the bagger.

Look at history up to 1995 the government had shut downs almost every two years this is not a very uncommon thing it just has not happened in a while.  Secondly someone giving their opinion about making a budget is no reason to attack them the fact remains that those of us and I include myself that live pay check to pay check as you put it still have room to budget a savings of some sort in order to be prepared for scenarios such as this.  Perhaps if those of you that are panicking so much would have cut out a Starbucks coffee here or there or perhaps didn't buy that video game you so desperately needed you could have put some money away so that you were not so concerned about missing a paycheck.  Seriously people you all seem to have nothing better to do than get on here and berate people for having an opinion however expect yours to be heard without criticism.

To which I reply ok fine I was simply putting it back before rolling again so that I wouldn't have to mess with it while driving or pull over after going through the gate to put my ear piece back in.  To which I get the response, the rules are you can't have the ear piece in while going through the gate.  That makes no sense since it is also local state law that I have to use a hands free device.  Please clarify this and if possible pass it to whoever needs to be aware of this so they can inform the gate gaurds because at first I thought it was just a fluke, then it happened to someone next to me one day and then to me yet again.

Frequently Asked Questions:

*Is this an actual emergency?*

No, this is only a monthly communications test. No further action is required. In the event of an actual emergency, we would provide additional information in the body of the message.

*Why do you do this test?*

This post is part of a base-wide monthly communication test. The test message confirms our ability to communicate using this platform.

*Do I need to acknowledge I received this message?""

No, the test message is merely confirmation that we are able to distribute information, if needed. No action/confirmation is required.

*Do you really think Facebook is best way to alert people to an emergency situation?*

Social media platforms are not emergency alert systems - but they are a powerful means of getting information to a large number of people in a relatively short time. Facebook is just one of the many communication tools JBLM would employ to distribute important information to members of our community during and after an emergency situation. Social networking also means that an engaged community sharing and re-sharing important info via social media can help emergency management officials reach far more people than relying on Emergency Alert Systems, alone.

*But this alert went out yesterday, and I didn't see in on my newsfeed until today!""

But this could also be true if emergency information sent to your email, if you didn't happen to be logged in to your email account. Or for info sent to you by text message, if you weren't carrying your cell phone at the time. This is one of the benefits of sharing information via multiple sources - it increases the odds that you will get the information in a timely manner. No communication method can guarantee that all potentially affected parties will be contacted, but our expectation is we will use every available means to reach as many potentially affected people as possible if the nature of the emergency requires it.

*I live out of state. Why is this even in my newsfeed, and what could I possibly do with this information if this was an actual emergency?*

If the info is in your newsfeed, you probably ""liked"" the JBLM Facebook page at some point in time, possibly because you know someone at or have an interest in activities at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. If the information doesn't apply to you, you may disregard it. If you know people the information might apply to, we hope you would consider sharing it with them. Also, if you have a friend or loved one here, we hope that information we share would help provide information about the evolving emergency, answer questions, and possibly help alleviate concerns until you can re-establish direct communication with your family or friends.",2013-09-18T20:32:47+0000,10151560018126199_26216224,288818151198,4

My daughter Mallorie has started 1st grade. She has special needs and requires a full time nurse, and interpreter (sign language). At first she is very shy, she has to know her surrounding before she opens up. Today her teacher called all the children to sit down in circle time. She asked all the children to say their names and their favorite color. As the children each took their turn. Mallorie watched her interpreter sign each name and color. As they got closer to Mallorie..  I thought maybe she will have the interpreter say as she signs, maybe she will shut down and won't say anything. 
No! She said her name and favorite color. I knew at that point she was going to do great! She has been through so much, but seeing her today made me feel so great as a parent.

Your base pay is higher so in the long run we still have a smaller take home than you. If the NCO housing had AC and the enlisted didn't would it be ok because your BAH is higher?. It's obvious just by looking at the housing on post that they're not all equal. You get a choice when you apply for housing and once assigned a unit you can always decline it. It'd be the same off post as well. Some rentals have AC and some don't. It just happens to be set up that the enlisted are in those houses and NCO's are in the other.

The discoloration is normally caused by deposits, sediment, or rust that have accumulated over time and are dislodged by maintenance work or a sudden change in water pressure. JBLM crews also flush water mains on a regular basis as part of our preventive maintenance program (the schedule for any planned flushing program is publicized in advance to alert residents to possible water quality effects in their neighborhood). The particles aren't a health issue, but they can impact taste or discolor clothing and other items that come in contact with the discolored water. Flushing the lines by running cold water for up to 30 minutes will usually remove the contamination and resolve the problem.",2013-06-28T02:02:52+0000,10151419117811199_8498642,288818151198,0

Line up 6-12 outfits on hangers, slide a trashbag up from the bottom to cover the clothes, and pull the drawstring tight around the neck of the hangars, then tie it closed. When you get to your destination, hang the whole set on the clothes-rod in your new closet, untie the bag, and all your clothes are put away and ready to wear. (If you untie it carefully enough, you can even re-use the garbage bag for trash). I also use newspaper and saran wrap to protect awkwardly-shaped items - or anything prone to scuffing in transit (it holds together better than tape).",2013-06-14T20:46:18+0000,10151396706801199_25207781,10202462607445728,0

Childcare - there are other providers, hourly providers included, that are available. It may not be as convenient but it's there. As a civilian, I'd never expect my job to work around my schedule just so my husband could utilize their gym (and we do have and are allotted gym time where I'm employed), nor would he be complaining about hourly cuts at our lower cost/preferred child care...they'd tell him to kick rocks. We both knew the sacrifices we would have to make as a family with two working parents.  The same as single income families, stay at home moms, work out of the home moms...they all make sacrifices for what's best for the family. It doesn't mean we expect everything to change for us because of it. It wouldn't change in the civilian world, why is it expected in the military world?

Ref. the recycle center - at one time, a container was provided as a courtesy for individuals using the recycle center (for example, to dispose of items  mistakenly brought to the center that could not be accepted as recyclable material). Unfortunately, some individuals used the container to dispose of excess household trash, rather than upgrading their residential trash service, and as the costs escalated the decision was made to remove the container.",2013-05-06T19:32:50+0000,10151341238501199_24770115,288818151198,0

13599,288818151198_10151341238501199,1. I see no point in dumping trash on our natural resources as if it will magically disappear. For that I feel that having this gentlemen is key.,2013-05-07T23:20:58+0000,10151341238501199_24783716,10152453732073167,0
13600,288818151198_10151341238501199,"I think there's a couple of different opinions being expressed - one is that there are people who are unhappy with recent changes to their trash service, and another that paying an investigator is a waste of taxpayer money.

Household trash in office dumpsters is a potential expense to the government - and in my personal opinion, worth policing for that reason. Just my opinion, and you may or may not agree - but it's the same stance taken by most organizations that rent dumpsters outside the installation.

But the even more serious problem is illegal dumping on the training areas - where the items are not only larger and even more expensive to dispose of, but frequently an environmental, and occasionally even a life/health/safety hazard - we're talking broken furniture, large appliances, abandoned vehicles, propane tanks & worse. Hopefully, none of that is coming from base housing. Either way, I think going after the dumpers is the right thing to do.

Also, what's up with the traffic light right off post, outside the Dupont gate.
Ive noticed its been backing up traffic leaving post and we pile up on the bridge.
Today when I left post and started to cross over the bridge, the light turned red, and several of us were like sitting ducks on that bridge.
Normally, it is green with a green left turning light (access I-5 N) in sync with the light right after the guard gate. It was a little unnerving, sitting there over I-5.
It started being out of sync about a week ago, but today was the first time we were all stuck sitting on the bridge.

The new sign is good for the affected Lakewood residents, but it achieves this by making outbound JBLM traffic wait longer, by eliminating the Nottingham Rd alternative. The sign was installed by Lakewood, not JBLM.

My tattoos are military and patriotic in nature and have several different meanings to me.  I do see how they can be considered unproffesional though.  My personal feelings are that they should not show in uniform as to not distract from the professional appearence.  In addition to that we will all be civilians some day and it could keep you from getting some jobs which Soldiers should take into consideration when getting a tattoo.  I also don't think that the military should be supporting Soldiers gettting a tattoo by bringing in a tattoo artist into a location such as GITMO.  bottom line is that tattoos do not keep a Soldier from being a good Soldier.

14111,288818151198_159910537499160,"Jessica Peppard- If your husband is collecting BAH at the 2012 E6 with dependents rate, gets promoted, and does not change duty stations, he would normally collect BAH at the 2013 E7 with dependents rate... unless that rate is lower than what he was receiving as an E6, in which case rate protection applies and he will continue collecting BAH at the 2012 E6 rate. The ""rate protection"" ends if he becomes ineligible for the with dependents rate, gets demoted, or PCSes... in which case, he would begin collecting BAH at the current rate for his new paygrade, dependent status, and duty station. If BAH is ""protected"" at a previous rate and the current BAH for his rank/pay grade/status rises above the protected rate, BAH will be adjusted to the new, higher amount.

14186,288818151198_274314229365936,"I'm honestly not at all surprised that you gave us less than 18 hours notice of this spectacularly bad decision that you call a traffic revision.  This will primarily only inconvenience Junior Enlisted housing residents, as they are majority of traffic that make that left hand turn into the housing area.  In fact, only residents and services; school buses, LeMay, moving trucks, USPS, and other deliveries make that turn.  Way to show the bottom that the top cares about them.  Ever wonder why moral is low?  See above.  People that can SEE their housing from the turn they cannot now make must make a 3 mile EACH WAY detour down to Jackson and back along Hillside, in traffic.  This is a monumentally bad decision that affects pretty much ONLY housing residents.  Way to go, JBLM!",2013-02-13T23:26:50+0000,274314229365936_1202377,10152342959132351,0
14187,288818151198_274314229365936,"Carson - The ""peak traffic"" detour for Garcia will be off Tacoma Ave. (it's the purple arrow, on the diagram). From 6-9AM & 3-6PM only, traffic from 41st Division Dr. to Hillside will be detoured - but it's just 1 extra block along 41st Division to Tacoma Ave., and then you'll need to backtrack 1 block to proceed straight on Garcia Blvd. (rather than entering Garcia via a left had turn from Colorado).

The reason for the change is that the distance from Garcia to 41st Division along Colorado is very short, and traffic behind drivers waiting to make the left hand turn could back up onto 41st Division... which would cause major problems and could even spill over onto I5 during peak travel hours. While the detour won't eliminate the wait to cross Colorado/enter Garcia, there will be fewer cars in line and more ""wiggle room"" by having Hillside drivers approaching via 41st Division detour that1 block, to approach Garcia from across the intersection.

The other change to the traffic plan will actually benefit residents of Hillside - by opening a 2nd east-west detour for the closed portion of Pendleton, overall traffic along Colorado Ave. will be greatly reduced compared to the previous plan (where Colorado had been scheduled to serve as the primary detour). This should make it much easier for residents to drive in & out of the housing area than under the earlier plan.",2013-02-13T23:58:38+0000,274314229365936_1202425,288818151198,0

This detour was not planned with residents in mind, that much is sure.  And assuring residents that traffic will improve for everyone else because we are not in it is pretty insulting.

How would you feel if you were dual military and your spouse and you got orders to different bases very far away from each other? You will be forced to pick between love and your career.  Although its not guaranteed, the Army's Married Couples Program can substantially reduce the likelihood of this happening. I think it's wonderful that the military is finally evolving and acknowledging commitment.

If all these roads are closed forcing all kinds of traffic down East Gate/Stryker Ave (along with the fact that the units along this road tend to not conduct PT) then 41st (as it wraps around the back of the 3rd BDE area) should be left open to allow more traffic to flow.

Going overboard makes it impossible to do our jobs, because now we have to spend too much effort concerned that we might somehow upset one unreasonable person.

It's already been established that things such as a bikini clad woman whose is related to the person is acceptable as long as it isn't displayed carelessly.  Now various inspectors insert their own ideas for what they consider poor taste would be and such, even when contrary to existing guidelines.

Call me a complainer all you want all I care about is safety for my solider and yours guess nobody see's that. Guess you don't under stand till it happens to you.

14629,288818151198_10151130460941199,Wait did she just say its been a problem for 8 YEARS!!! Well 8 years experience should tell you that it's a problem which should tell you to slow down and it should tell the army's soldier and your husband to allow extra time in the morning to get to work given the time of year and possible road conditions. I'm sorry about his previous accident that sucks no matter how you dress it up but that should also give some inclination that the roads this time of year are potentially dangerous. Salting the road is what I think your referring to when you talk about sand and gravel and even that doesn't ensure clear and safe roads no matter what time of day. If you are concerned about east gate rd. then have your husband take an alternate way to work.

I have been trying to find local relief drives to donate to in aid of hurricane Sandy relief efforts. So far, I have yet to succeed. I contacted many humanitarian aids such as Goodwill and Salvation Army. No one seems to be doing anything locally except donating money online. That is great, but I would like to get something set up here at my command or even a base wide thing to send supplies. The closest thing I have found in the area is JBLM sending vehicles and personnel to assist. Is there anyone I could possibly talk to about maybe having a flight set up to take supplies if I could get something going? I would really like to help, and know many others that do. I just do not have a way to do it. Please let me know! Thank you very much in advance!",2012-11-13T21:19:31+0000,113472072146620_72820,10153234616508202,0

I think what you're looking for is a civilian/volunteer disaster relief agency - and as a govt. organization, we wouldn't be able to suggest any specific one -  however, the American Red Cross is one agency that does a lot of work in this area.

However, disaster-relief and response experts we coordinate with have told us that many relief agencies no longer accept ""in-kind"" donations like food or supplies from individuals because maintaining facilities or contracting support to receive, assess, sort, store, transport, and distribute items actually costs more than purchasing any necessary supplies from businesses in (or just outside) the affected area during a relief effort.",2012-11-13T22:03:39+0000,113472072146620_72916,288818151198,0

This is a frequent topic of discussion among Madigan staff and patients. New lots and clinics have helped, but the medical center still comes up short when it comes to prime parking during peak hours. 

When the facility was designed and built the installation was a much different place than it is now. Over the years both the base population and the numer of staff at Madigan have grown, and the medical center parking lot is just one of the places where that growth is highly visible. 

To answer your original question, is parking simply was not an issue when the facility was designed and built. However, a garage like the one you mentioned has been discussed many times over the years, but has never proven to be a viable solution for the medical center.",2012-11-06T20:48:21+0000,441960415867283_4257616,293304441350,0
14833,288818151198_441960415867283,"One way Madigan patients can help is to sign up for our secure messaging service and avoid trips to the facility when an in-clinic appointment is not required. Some civilian health care providers use similar online services for as much as 60 percent of routine appointments. Each online appointment has the potential to open up a parking space for a fellow patient. 

But, the benefits go well beyond parking spots. Madigan's service allows patients to communicate directly with their healthcare team via secure messaging. Registered users can also order prescription refills, veiw lab results, and schedule face to face appointments. If you're intersted, your primary care provider can tell you how to register for the service.",2012-11-06T21:05:00+0000,441960415867283_4257671,293304441350,0

If you are speaking of the crummy feeling some people experience after the flu shot; it may not be all in your head. Mercury is used in accounts sufficient for a heavier than average make receiving the same shot. It is a low form of mercury poisoning that you feel; however, with a healthy filtration system (kidneys, liver) that amount dissipates over a very few days with little more side effect than eating fresh fish. I'm not sure how how old or young you are but regardless there after things to be learned in an entry level Microbiology course that can be very comforting. Rest assured you certainly aren't getting the flu from it. The virus has a small portion of its DNA that scientifically cannot, will not ever reproduce. EVER. Studies mounted against vaccines wetter fraudulently performed for the sole financial gain of a selfish and knowingly dishonest physician that has been disbarred and imprisoned for his research that showed deliberate tampering and academic dishonesty. He became a millionaire practically by his fiasco and to this day in some parts of IOWA people still refrain from shots based on his studies. Hope this helps and want offensive.

Many of us couldn't stay for whole show and left early, only to be locked and not move for 3 hours, while the rest of the base could leave which is unacceptable, in many cases people who stayed for entire show got off base before we did having left at 3pm. Had we known of this closing, many of us would have requested to not park in this lot, but we were directed there by your MP's when entering. When asking MP's and other soldiers what is going on, we were rudely responded to and told to just wait as the lights were backing people  up, not that we were locked in.

Now factor in congestion, pollution, cost of fuel. Not the best choices. Also the outbound East Gate road at 507 is already terrible and dangerous, with people driving long distances up the shoulder to turn right or go across. That road needs to be widened into two lanes.

15451,288818151198_10150817492966199,Closing the Roy gate is going to cause more problems than it solves. The turn lanes at the East Gate intersection are not long enough coming from either direction ( not to mention the roads are still single lane use only for through traffic). Cars will block the intersection trying to make up some time for the longer commute. There will be more accidents and not just because people are rushing but because they will be tired ( less sleep due to getting themselves and children up much earlier to try and  beat traffic). More Units coming home In Dec. plus added Units from TX. will add to this problem. I haven't even begun to address the issue about quicker access to the hospital when a sick child in involved.

The soldiers' schedules are so unpredictable that it's near impossible to have 2 people who live in the same area to carpool together since they never seem to know what time they'll be off of work.  I understand that Fort Hood has scattered arrival and release times for each of their units to help mitigate traffic problems (I've never been there, but my husband has and has told me this).  In a line unit, I've seen release times range anywhere from 1700 to 2100, and, again, they're unpredictable based on what commanders and 1SGs have going on for the soldiers on that particular day.  The soldiers almost never know ahead of time what the next day is going to hold.  Therefore, if my husband were to carpool with someone else from the same unit, and they happen to have to stay later than he does or vice versa, one person is now forced to stay at work longer to wait for the other, taking precious time away from their family.  I know there's no way to make work schedules more predictable because each unit has different tasks to complete each day, but I know our family won't run the risk of having to wait around when he can drive himself to work and come home when he gets off of work without having to wait around for someone else.",2012-05-16T18:02:25+0000,218044911646626_734598,10101255923251803,3

15526,288818151198_218044911646626,"thank you very much. Pierce transit should look into acquiring federal funding or grants to accommodate those routes that cater to JBLM seeing as how Pierce county voters refuse to assist in funding the program. Pierce transit would have a legitimate argument considering that communities surrounding JBLM are largely composed of service members, JBLM employees, retirees and DOD civilians. Also, it almost seems that staggered release times would be a necessity given JBLM's urban location, but that is a command and leadership discretion. Commanders should be encouraged to deviate from the normal 9-5 scheduling, Boeing and Microsoft are aware of these circumstances and cater to their employees to better accommodate these conditions by staggering work shifts, happy soldiers are retainable soldiers.                                        In regards to Pierce transits ridership numbers it might be safe to assume that those number might have been low due to a lack of awareness. JBLM communities are ever changing, PCS's, ETS's, deployments, TDY's. Its easier for soldiers to hop in there POV's and go, especially with unpredictable duties or details in a given day. Thats why I think if well established, reliable, and consistent routes were appropriated and advertised, ridership numbers would in turn increase. I know I would partake if there were a more direct route from puyallup. This is also why I think the duty shuttle is a good and long over due idea. It should also not be a pilot program, it should be permanent. The principle I explained for Pierce transit should be applied towards the duty shuttle. If its reliable, well established, consistent and JBLM residents are aware of these traits, usage should increase. That would mean more routes and less wait times. Units also have a plethora of resources just sitting in motor pools to accommodate soldiers using duty shuttles and leaving POV's at home. Unit vehicles should be better used during duty hours, again a leadership and command discretion. Im sure post conditions would be considered when evaluating ridership for the duty shuttle, such as post population due to deployments and redeployments, in order to properly assess the programs effectivity.",2012-05-17T04:44:27+0000,218044911646626_736281,10153679470041489,0

Those unpredictable nights happen at least 2 or 3 times a week in line units, from what I've seen.  When my husband was down in a line unit, there would be weeks in a row where he wouldn't get home until 2100 every night.  The best possible solution would be staggering arrival and departure times by brigade and also staggering lunch times.  But there's never any guarantee the units will listen.

15545,288818151198_203912089730511,"Joy Nielsen Hall - this is a National Park Service initiative, so they can answer this with a lot more authority than we could. But this is what the story on the DoDLive blog says:

""Military members and their dependents can pick up a pass at any national park or wildlife refuge that charges an entrance fee or other selected sites. Members must show a current, valid military identification card to obtain their pass. The pass is also available to dependents of active duty personnel... Where there are entrance fees, the pass covers the owner and accompanying passengers in a single, private, non-commercial vehicle at recreation sites that charge per vehicle. At sites where per-person entrance fees are charged, it covers the pass owner and three accompanying adults age 16 and older. There is no entry fee for children 15 and under."" 

Based on the stated criteria, I'd think military dependents could obtain a pass that would cover admission for him/herself and guests (which could include a non-military caretaker) but you should check with NPS and/or the park you plan to visit, to be sure.",2012-05-17T19:24:05+0000,203912089730511_600622,288818151198,0

We definitely have been on a learning curve with getting this garden up and running but every year there have been improvements. If you're at all still interested, please call me at 966-1734 and I'll make sure you get your beds from last year back. Last year, we provided soil (or dirt) but it wasn't up to par -- apologies for that. We have some good compost being moved out there this week. I also didn't realize people were having problems with theft. I have a couple of beds out there and may have had a carrot or two stolen by a rabbit but nothing else. If it continues I'll look into ways to deter it. And, yes, there may be people who use Miracle Gro; fully organic is hard to enforce. However, I can say with confidence that the garden is pesticide-, herbicide-, fungicide-free.

16015,288818151198_266982503388007,"No, Diana, we aren't. However, there are many areas that leave room for improvement. I have no issues with the care Madigan provides to the families and soldiers as I have almost always had wonderful care, especially from the general surgery Blue team! I have had 4 out of five surgeries performed by them over the last 18 months. I can't say enough about them! That being said, I have heard several ""horror stories"" from soldiers going thru the MEB/PEB process. They were awful enough that I just couldn't believe what I was hearing given the level of care I have received. That was until my family and I started living it over six months ago.  It's not the actual care given to the wounded soldier that is lacking, but the lack of care in how the soldier is treated. If you ever want to know what it feels like to be treated as if you have the plague, tell your provider you are in the MEB/PEB process. It's literally like someone flips a switch inside the provider and the outward concern for the soldier's well being is gone in a flash. I have never witnessed such unprofessional behavior towards a patient as I have over this past 6 months. I have gone to the patient advocate over this more than once and because the staff sticks together and denies the behaviors, nothing can be done to make them stop treating our wounded and injured soldiers so awfully. What has absolutely disgusted me the most is that the ones that are the most guilty of the negative behaviors are soldiers themselves! It blows my mind! My husband was injured at work last August and it has literally taken up until about 3 weeks ago to find ONE provider that actually cared enough to try to help my husband. These soldiers, ALL soldiers,  have earned the right to top notch health care delivered with compassion and empathy, and they usually get it, until those six magic letters come out (MEB/PEB). It truly worries me to think if it is so easy for them to treat my husband this way, you know they are doing it to others as well. My husband even had one provider who literally laughed at and made fun of him for being in extreme pain. This, above all else, is what needs to be cut out like it is a cancer lesion. The fact of the matter is that certain providers have no qualms about down playing a soldier's injury whether it is physical or mental. I do have to give the nursing staff at Madigan mass kudos! Each and every nurse that has even walked past us in the hall has stopped and showed caring, kindness, and compassion to both of us, even when they have never met us before that moment. This is how ALL soldiers deserve to be treated, no matter the health issue, battle wounds, or injuries. This tells me that we are not ""broken"", only ""wounded"" in the psychosocial care provided. I pray every night that the public ""fits"" I have thrown over this will change how the providers are allowed to treat our soldiers so that no one else ever has to be subjected to the cruel, psychological terrorism that  many of our soldiers going thru the MEB/PEB have  already been subjected to.

Regarding your first comment; the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit is currently in search of an RN qualified to work in that fast-paced environment. Our nurse recruiter has been working to fill this position for quite some time, and once the vacancy is filled availabilty will increase accordingly. The position/application is available at... https://careers-civilianmedicaljobs.icims.com/jobs/1182/job. We are also very, very sorry to hear about your loss. 

Regarding your third comment we couldn't agree more. While it may not always be apparent, the bond that we share with our beneficiaries is very strong at the MTF level. Our uniformed providers, nurses, medics, and other staff deploy right along side their FORSCOM counterparts. As a matter of fact Col. Homas was the Division Surgeon for the 25th ID as well as the Corps Surgeon for I Corps. He has incredibly strong ties to those in uniform... especially those on JBLM. He is honored and truly considers it a privelege to provide to them with the best care possible.    

Madigan is constantly trying to improve access to care and the actual care that service members recieve with initiatives such as the newly-opened Soldier Centered Medical Home. Unfortunately, sometimes our efforts aren't percieved in the way they were intended to, or actually operate. 

Granted, sometimes it may not seem to be the case, but at the end of the day Madigan's mission is to provide standards-based, values driven care to service members, their family members.",2012-02-23T16:21:18+0000,307496515977717_3332177,293304441350,0

We are sorry to hear that sometimes you consider the health care experience at Madigan frustrating and disheartening. We are constantly trying to improve every aspect of the patient experience. But, things need to be brought to our leadership's attention to change. 

One of the best ways to provide feedback is through the Army Provider Level Satisfaction Survey that is sent out to patients following appointments. The results are used to gather feedback on individual providers as well as other aspects of our facility such as the pharmacy. The MTF's scores are a constant focus of  Madigan's leadership as well as our higher headquarters. 

ICE comments are another way you can influence change at Madigan. While the do not provide the large scale feedback that the surveys do, they are a great way to let us know when something is not quite right. 

Finally, you may also resolve issues through the clinic's chain of command. If they can't remedy the problem please contact our patient advocacy office at 253-968-1145 and they will act on your behalf.",2012-02-23T16:40:02+0000,307496515977717_3332308,293304441350,0

As Rachel mentioned, the construction taking place near the pond has nothing to do with any kind of rennovation or expansion of the pond (which is actually part of the medical center's cooling system designed to increase efficiency and decrease environmental impact).

The Madigan Healthcare System's Facebook page is always open for comments and discussion. In some ways the page is used as an ongoing town hall where patients and the American public can ask questions, provide feedback, and discuss current events related to the Madigan Healthcare System. 

While our staff attempts to address all comments in a timely manner, the scope and complexity of Madigan's mission occasionally requires the input of various medical and subject matter experts prior to posting a response. This is the primary reason that a virtual town hall, with a finite duration, might not be the best venue to address complex issues/topics. Additionally, due to the nature of Madigan's health care mission and DoD/Army regulations there are certain things that cannot be discussed in a public forum (for example... things related to patient privacy). Outside of those topics prohibited by law, regulation, and our user guidelines we welcome the opportunity to discuss anything that pertains to Madigan's mission openly and honestly.

But, I myself use the gym every day and I do see alot of the same women in there on a regular basis.  I am not going to calm to know the finacial status of everyone.  That being said there are gyms off post who provide childcare that is included in their monthly fee.  Why not offer something similar, we are allowed 2 hours a day, 6 days a week per child.  Why not set a price per month for that amount of time per household not child.  I think you would keep more clients that way.  I for one can not afford the $4 an hour per child.

I didnt check it since I didnt want to open in causing it to lose its temp and spoil the foods if it were still good but when the power came on last night, it had been on for about 40 minutes and things were cold... yet I dont know how low it got since my daughters ice cream birthday cake is melted! I dont really wanna chance feeding my two toddlers spoiled food or myself since I am pregnant so is there anyway you guys can pass along some safety info on this sort of situation? Also I know most renters insurance will cover lost food in these situations (We were in KY for the ice storm of 2009 and got reimbursed for our food loss) Does the insurance our BAH helps pay for cover this as well?

Not to mention what the worked this weekend when the problems first started occuring. They normally have 4 people per electric crew to climb, cut and remove trees and limbs that are taking down power lines (which is what my step dad does) but because of how much work there is for them to do, they had to cut the crews in half. So now 2 people are doing the job of 4 not to mention what the linemen have to do for the power lines themselves. Some of the problems that caused the power outages are so dangerous that they can't even get to them until conditions lighten up a bit. The lift truck for his crew that carries them up to limbs and power lines actually froze and couldn't be used for quite a while. He and my mom still don't have power either and they live in an area surrounded by people who do which as you know is very disheartening especially since he has spent all of his recent time turning it on for others.

My sons body was unable to handle a generic med for his Endocrine issues due to a brain tumor.  So now they are punishing those not using their Pharmacy, for real. I'm so calling my congressman.

The cost of these medications are outrageous and to complain that our co pays are too high is also outrageous, we need to be thankful that we don't have to pay as much as the person standing in front of us.

As well as his Levoxyl the gineric does not work for him either. They in no way are the same, not even close.  Even his Endocrine Drs at Seattle Children's and Swedish said the same thing.  I gave the TRICARE Pharmacy three rounds of meds to give them time to fix their issues.  Each time we were shipped the wrong meds.  The Drs at Children's stated ""Name Brand"" and they (TRICARE Pharmacy) took it upon themselves to change my sons meds.  I called and they said they send out the Generic whenever it is avaialble, because its cheaper for them that way. Its not the Drs issues its  TRICARE POLICY issues.  Believe me if Generic would work we'd get it.  In addition I nearly puke every month when I see that TRICARE Insurance has paid over $1000 for my son's DDAVP.  Not to mention his GH that is over $4000 a month as well.  Im beyond grateful believe me, God and I talk a lot.

I'm not able to see my son off & noone has been able to offer me any information about a way for family members to stay in contact.  I'm sure that there is something like that for family members that live ON BASE.....but what about family members that do not???  This is my son's first deployment, and needless to say, I am a nervous wreck.
SOOOO.....I would like to see links to some support sites set up for family members that can support each other and to just get information or ask questions.  I feel like I've been stonewalled and just kept being told, ""sorry, ma'am, can't help you.""

I can tell you as a seasoned Army Ranger mom, that the first deployment is the hardest in a lot of ways!

Our second son just got to JBLM a couple weeks ago and will also be deploying shortly. His older brother is waiting on his orders to move there this month!

18220,288818151198_10150247536521199,"@Callie - this is the JBLM garrison page, so our focus is sharing info on behalf of the installation. Since there are 40,000 Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors & Marines on JBLM, most units also maintain their own Facebook pages for info specific to their units... and each unit has its own family readiness organization - many of which also have pages! Is it possible one of those was the page you were directed to?

Facebook is a public site and there are operationally sensitive subjects surrounding deployments that can't be discussed in an open forum. So, most Army units & Family Readiness Groups also employ some sort of alternate system - a phone tree, an email list, or a non-public ""virtual FRG"" site - to communicate specific information to families during deployment.

Would you email me your son's name and unit ID & your own contact info at JBLMIMCOMPAO@conus.army.mil (put ""Attn. Catherine Caruso"" in the subject line)? That way, I can forward it to the family readiness support assistant at your son's unit & they can make sure you have the right info before he deploys.",2011-08-07T02:23:19+0000,10150247536521199_17238993,10202462607445728,2

He turns 5 on Spt 18 this year and Clover Park District does not provide early entrance testing options for him, Tacoma does but we are not part of that district.  This means my son which has been assisting to preschool since he was a year and a half old in now being left without his right to keep on learning and socializing except me taking him to the park or play pen? I also called parent central regarding to summer camps or programs but still he has to be already 5 years old.  I think preschoolers are being really kept away from their right to learn and develop more independently from their mothers, even though I am not working here now he really needs to keep on with his learning habits and friendship and social skills.

The fact of the matter is that there are well over 150,000 soldiers stationed at Fort Lewis, most of whom live off base and drive themselves to work.  Parking is atrocious because despite the year that construction workers had to get things done in the Stryker Brigade areas, they just started on it a couple of months ago, meaning that parking has been an issue for all the Brigades.  As a spouse, I stay off post whenever possible, and if I need to go to the Commissary or PX, I go to McChord, mostly because it is closer to me.  Opening more gates would probably help with traffic problems, but I know that requires more money out of the budget to pay for security guards.  Perhaps you noticed that while everyone was deployed that there was NO traffic.  Doesn't that tell you that the problem lies in the logistics of the post rather than calling every driver a ""part of the problem?""",2010-11-18T01:02:12+0000,109182359151256_209310,10101255923251803,3

Stay away from traffic circles - they don't work.  Widen the roads, include turning lanes, stagger lunch time breaks.  
Ask the state to keep that weight station by the golf course closed during peak hours.  And has anyone considered multi-level parking garages.  Quite a bit of the driving time is looking for a parking spot.

Or, since everyone is doing PT from 630-730, open up all the roads you have blocked off until 800. Stryker Rd/East Gate Rd alone is a nightmare! To turn Right off of 2nd Division onto Stryker takes 25 minutes in itself. If that went straight through to where you could turn Right onto 42nd Division (unless it changes name when it curves around towards 3rd BDE's motorpool), it would alleviate the traffic problem. You have 4th BDE and all the units in that area turning Right onto Stryker Ave meanwhile you have all of 3rd BDE and those units on the Left trying to turn Left infront of everyone on Stryker.
