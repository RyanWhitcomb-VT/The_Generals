Spouses are the primary family member and most important relation in a serving soldiers personal environment, next to the small and dependent children of course. It is the spouse who remains next to the soldier and supports his service at all times by holding his six while he/she is deployed. We see too often the irrational MOTHER CULT take charge and mothers be honored for losing their sons or daughters, and while certainly each parent mourns naturally the loss of their child, the awarding of mothers for having lost the child they once have  born/ the fallen son or daughter/ of course always gives the impression that they are being honored for the product they made for a country's consumption and then made feel they made a sacrifice when actually in today's world the US Forces are all volunteers. A soldier's service is a matter of honor and loyalty to his/her country and the sacrifice lies with their children and spouse. It is after all the military spouse who holds the family together, ensures that children are brought up properly and the military service member has his/her back free to fulfill his/her duty to his/her country. It is a wonderful shift to show appreciation to those who live the life, are the life, and direct and supporting family of the service member, and those who are most affected by the loss, spouses and small children. It is the spouse whose sacrifice the death of a soldier is.",2013-04-04T17:24:57+0000,408589435904736_2264673,561296967319892,1

The United States Honor Flag arrived in Anchorage Sunday to honor the memory of Georg Greaser, a Fort Greely Army police officer who died in the line of duty Thursday.

This is the second time the Honor Flag has been in Alaska.  It was flown to the state in 2010 to honor the late senator Ted Stevens and the Hoonah police officers who were killed in the line of duty that August.

The flag was originally a gift given by the Texas House of Representatives to Chris Heisler.  Heisler transported the flag to ground zero in New York City shortly after the September 11th terrorist attacks in 2001, and it has been a part of memorial services for fallen heroes ever since.",2012-12-31T08:42:10+0000,466252650098086_86481833,134243133299041,5

For twenty years
This sailor has stood the watch

While some of us were in our bunks at night
This sailor stood the watch

While some of us were in school learning our trade
This shipmate stood the watch

Yes.. even before some of us were born into this world
This shipmate stood the watch

In those years when the storm clouds of war were seen brewing on the horizon of history
This shipmate stood the watch

Many times he would cast an eye ashore and see his family standing there
Needing his guidance and help
Needing that hand to hold during those hard times
But he still stood the watch

He stood the watch for twenty years
He stood the watch so that we, our families and
Our fellow countrymen could sleep soundly in safety, Each and every night
Knowing that a sailor stood the watch

Relieved by those You have trained ,Guided, and Lead

720,134243133299041_359779330766719,"Message to the IMCOM Workforce From Lt. Gen. Michael Ferriter and Cmd. Sgt. Maj. Earl Rice

The Installation Management Command has the best workforce we have seen in each of our 30-plus years of service.  At every installation, base and depot we visit, we are impressed by the spirit, energy and teamwork exhibited by the IMCOM team.

We are just as inspired by the dedicated professionals in the IMCOM and region headquarters, who oversee operations that stretch around the globe from Japan and Korea, across the continental United States, to Europe, and even into bases in Afghanistan.  Simply said, no one touches our Soldiers, our Army Families and our civilian workforce and retirees like we do-every day.

In August, we marked the 10th anniversary of the installation management team-first IMA and then IMCOM.  That means we have experienced 10 years of evolution in our mission, our workforce and our methods of installation service delivery.

Those who have been with the organization all or most of that time know it has been a constant learning experience in a business with really high stakes-the quality of life of our all-volunteer force.  Sustaining such a high quality force relies heavily on us, the installation management professionals, succeeding in our mission.

The installation management team has performed magnificently this year, just as it has in past years.  Our ability to deliver services every day ensures our Soldiers and Families know we care about them and appreciate their service.

The entire Army is now affected by force and funding reductions.  This means IMCOM will also reshape and reduce in size.  This past year we accomplished all of our mandated reductions through voluntary actions.  We also retrained and reassigned people within our IMCOM team to allow for personal growth and to keep our team together.

Even as we reduced our numbers, we approved for hire almost 2,000 positions across IMCOM.  In fact, many of these are vacant and I invite you to the IMCOM Enterprise Placement Program to see what is there and if there is a position that interests you.

Our workforce development is second to none.  Our IMCOM Academy, developmental assignments, the mentor program, career program 29, and schools such as the Civilian Education System and the senior service colleges are providing immediate and positive return on investment in shaping our team for the future.

As we move into the year ahead, my goal is to create even more certainty for you.  I want IMCOM leaders at every level to increase communication to build understanding and certainty for our team.  We're getting ready for the next 10 years of world-class installation services, so we need to get it right now.

To all of our great civilians: thank you for your dedicated service.  Have a super weekend a great week ahead.

Army Strong!
Support and Defend
