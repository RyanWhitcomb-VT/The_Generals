6,116888017071_10154721029062072,This year has been one for the books; but my favorite moment is when my husband and his Band OutLaw who are all Active Military played on stage at the 4th Annual Veterans Salute in Hinesville Ga. November 5th this year. This was a absolute dream come true for him. He has had this dream since he was a teenager and it finally happened! I have never seen such a joy and happiness in him except when our children was born. I'm so Thankful that I was able to be there to share with him a dream of his THAT came true. We have been married 24 yrs and the joy in my heart on this day is beyond words.,2016-11-16T00:02:15+0000,10154721029062072_10154761026682072,10152672258734459,1
7,116888017071_10154721029062072,"My favorite memory of 2016 would be when all of our friends we have met through the Army during our stay here got together and went to Savannah. It's hard being so far from home and not being able to see family, but it's even harder when you make amazing friends who become family and then have to watch them move away. After Christmas the majority of our Army family will be spread across the country and we will stay here. So my favorite memory of this year that I will forever cherish is when we were all here together.

1791,116888017071_10151697060527072,"REPOSTING:
A stirring, colorful ?Salute to the Nation? ceremony, punctuated by the firing of one artillery round in honor of each of our nation?s 50 states and eight territories, will get under way at 8:30 p.m. July 4 at Cottrell Field on Fort Stewart.

 A fireworks display ? an Independence Day tradition Americans hold as dear as picnics, ball games, parades and cookouts in celebrating their freedom ? will follow the ?Salute to the Nation? ceremony.

 The site of the ceremony, Cottrell Field, is bordered by Warriors Walk, which honors Third Infantry Division warriors who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defending the freedom being celebrated July 4.

 Residents of communities neighboring Fort Stewart are invited to join 3rd Infantry Division Soldiers, Family Members and Army Civilians in the Salute to the Nation and in viewing the fireworks. Pets, smoking, large coolers, grills, glass bottles and weapons are prohibited.

 The flags of each of America?s states and her eight territories will be on display in front of the Cottrell Field viewing stands and bleachers.

 Patriotic music will be provided by members of the 3rd Infantry Division Band prior to and during the ceremony, as well as a reading of a brief history of the U.S.

 Hunter Army Airfield will celebrate the birth of our nation one day earlier, on July 3, with a fireworks display. Soldiers, Families and members of surrounding civilian communities are welcome to view the display at Family Day Field starting at 9 p.m.",2013-07-03T20:42:00+0000,10151697060527072_27741284,558565044257095,2

I have to say that I don't mind the price increase from $1 to $2 but I found it pretty ridiculous that I had to pay $2 for me just to be able to sit inside the fence to watch my kids. Nobody with kids under 5 is going to sit outside the fence while their toddler is running around in there esp when you are there when it isn't toddler time. What is the point of having kids under 2 free if you are just going to charge for the parent to go in with them. That isn't right. Also, it would be nice if you all offered some kind of family pass like you do for the pool paying 6 bucks a day almost every day gets expensive for everyone if you go multiple times a week.",2012-05-20T04:32:40+0000,10150907156592072_23116329,10205217900106336,4

Because I am out numbered I prefer the water park over the pool when my husband is not around. It is just safer and easier for us. I would go everyday ic it was not so expensive for us. I think they would deff be parents buying a season pass to this park if it was offered. I hope this option is considered by the staff if it has not already. I think more options to pay would increase buisness this summer. Maybe an unlimited pass to include skating lazer tag bowling and all activities as well. Also there could be an "" aqatics pass"" that would include a pass to all water activities and the pool. Obvikusly these passes would be mpre expensive but well worth it to large familys and or daycare providers (there are many of us on base).

The MWR listened to patrons and have built this wonderful dog park for the military community to keep dogs from running around where children play. I applaud the MWR for doing this and hope it keeps dogs off the playing and running fields.

3417,116888017071_10150534781707072,"I think breed restrictions are kinda silly for housing or dog park. So no one flip please, it's just my opinion. Leashes should be a must, unless they have a muzzle or whatever for everyone and every dogs safety. To me, it's like comparing it to race in a way. It may sound silly, but how can u stereotype every dog how it was ""bred in history""...I grew up with 2 rotweilers as a child and they were the biggest loving, yet protective babies and even then, they were happy to see strangers come in as guest and never bit anyone. Two years ago I had a poodle and chose not to keep her because she bit my mom in the face for no reason and always growled at her, I also have a jack russel who was an alpha female and after she had her pups and they were gone, she would CONSTANTLY attack my american bulldog/hound mix on a daily basis- she was 3 times her size, I had to get both of them stitches...no matter where u have the dogs, or what type of dog it is, the owner should be responsible and always take caution around any animal and the people they have the oog around, as we all learned in grade school:\ For people who get to take their pets, I hope everyone enjoys the park:)",2012-01-13T14:51:42+0000,10150534781707072_6212710,935617679809034,0

3594,116888017071_10150350647667072,"I SURVIVE OFF THE DAYCARE AT THE GYM!  Two years ago, there was  line out the door of people trying to get their kids into the daycare.  Since they re-opened after the fire, no one seems to use it anymore. Probably because they don't offer the classes anymore.  Regardless, the daycare gives me the opportunity to squeeze in an hour at the gym.  Yes, the times are limited, but it works for me.  I put $30 in my daycare account at CYS, go to the gym 3-4 days a week, and this usually lasts a month.  I do 30 mins of cardio and 30 mins of weight training.  $30 is cheaper than the YMCA and certainly worth being in shape :)",2011-10-05T14:51:59+0000,10150350647667072_19588630,10152351287824629,1

Until the registration option is available, we are developing a process where you can sign up on paper and tell us your interests (i.e. outdoor recreation, age 9 - 12 child activities, golf, etc.)  and how you want to receive messages and from that we will be able to send you messages however you want them about events and programs that you are interested in.

4308,116888017071_330130734466,"Thank you for posting this. The Fort Stewart Pet Boarding can only board dogs for 90 days due to kennel stress for the welfare of the pets.  For deployments and extended TDY/School periods, Dogs need to have a Family Care Plan in a home environment like other family members.  Remember your pets are Family members, and are not throw away items.  This is an excellent option for those who do not have family or friends to care for their pets in the midst of a deployment. Be sure to document have both parties all transactions, get an agreement in writing and prepare an allotment for food, vet bills, and upkeep of your pet during your absences. A Pet Power of Attorney will help your caretaker with vet and professional transactions as well. 

Come see us at the Fort Stewart Pet Boarding Facility. We offer grooming, doggie daycare and boarding. Located out at Holbrook Pond Rec Area!

Lisa Taitt- Fort Stewart Pet Boarding Facility Manager
