0,153055964751512_1189302644460167,I love this place! My 1st year in the area and we joined. Have you considered memberships with prices based on the amount of people in a family? I paid the same price for 2 people as my friends did for their family of 6. The price is a great deal for big families but for a single mom with 1 child it's way too expensive. I'd love to come back next year but I can't justify spending  $600 for 2 people. Too rich for my blood. :(,2016-09-07T11:11:04+0000,1189302644460167_1189314044459027,10203431007006270,0

Hello everyone!

Today is the last day to sign up for On The Lam and we are still looking for participants. If you haven't already and have an interest in joining please come to the Forge and sign up! If you are interested also email me so I can add you to our rosters!

A little bit about the program, this is a new event with an interactive twist. Runners/walkers will play a game of cops and robbers as they try to catch each other along the course. What's the twist? There will be road blocks and reward miles hidden along the way waiting to be unlocked. So as runners advance with their total miles they can reveal obstacles, mini challenges and prize miles along the way. We are sure to have fun with this event, so find some friends or coworkers and join us for a great fitness challenge!
