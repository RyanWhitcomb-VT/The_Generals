171,80128057786_10154474366902787,"I apologize in advance if I've chosen an inappropriate place to post a complaint. My husband is an Army retiree, today was Retiree Appreciation Day at Ft Meade, and ""appreciated"" would hardly describe how our visit to the ID Card office felt. My husband took leave from work today to accompany me, as is required. We arrived early for my 2pm appointment and were pleasantly greeted by the gentleman at the desk. Upon giving him my dependent ID card, he remarked that it was expired and put it under the desk. He then asked for two forms of identification. I gave him my MD driver's license and said my military ID was my other form of picture ID. And these two items were what I have always brought (for 40 years!) when renewing my military ID. I was asked if I had a passport or my Social Security card or a voter registration card on me. As someone who has been a victim of identity theft and who is married to a overly cautious member of law enforcement, I know it would be foolhardy to just happen to have these items on me. He did suggest my husband update his ID card while he was there so we sat down to wait. While waiting, I dug out my Maryland Vehicle Registration card and my husband brought that to the desk. No luck. Even though a state voter registration card without a picture would have been good enough. And it didn't matter that my drivers license comes from the same MVA office. My husband was most upset that he was there in person to vouch for me and for every item I showed the man with my name. We waited only ten minutes, then decided to leave. We will renew my ID at Andrews next week, in time for my surgery on the 31st when I will need to show my ID card to prove Tricare medical coverage. My husband is an Army retiree, our son is an active Army Major, and I'm a federal (DOD) civilian retiree myself. We're an Army family, and I hate that my Air Force friends are telling me I should have gone to Andrews in the first place. Live and learn, I guess. Thank you for reading my diatribe to the end!",2016-10-22T02:36:39+0000,10154474366902787_10154488681622787,1539921032959478,0

It seems that the timing of the two egress lights in the afternoon, 1 at Mapes and 175, the other at Mapes and Llewellyn, are not timed to permit optimal flow of traffic off post. Once the right turn lanes onto 175 are opened, this may be resolved, but for now, there needs to be either a longer light for the exit from Mapes onto 175. Then the problem is compounded by the timing of the Llewellyn light onto Mapes, where there is almost no traffic from up Mapes toward the intersection, and a high volume of traffic from Llewellyn onto Mapes to the exit. Please re-time those lights, or as MAJ Main suggested, have MPs on post and/or AACo PD direct traffic off post.

It can already be intimidating to go through the security process and the phone call seems to be an extra/unnecessary step. I've asked the guards and none of them seem to have a good understanding of why they are doing this either. Furthermore, if a visitor is going to the PX or the bowling alley there is no one to call and verify their purpose of coming on post. It just seems like an extra inconvenience to all parties (Including the guards). Can you please verify the necessity of this policy?

1601,80128057786_10153872254547787,"What Grand Opening? I was there when the new Officers Club opened up in 1982 and the Brass Rail, Chesapeake Lounge, and Dining room were run like a country club. A real class establishment filled with Army pride. Fort Meade had a NCO Club off Llewellyn road which was closed because of drugs, prostitution and theft. Guess what? The same people running the NCO Club in the MWR system got jobs running the Officer's Club and you can see what happened. There was a reason for separate clubs for different ranks. Officers could relax and vent their complaints in front of fellow officers and the NCOs could do the same in their own club. The lower ranks also had a place to do the same. Now we have Community Clubs (AKA Communist Clubs as far as I'm concerned) that no one goes to except for lunch. The FGGM Officers Club catering was so good that you had to book a year ahead of time for a wedding. Christmas, New Years Eve, Mardi Gras (Fasching) were all big events that reservations were required. I believe the reasoncited for the demise of the military club system was ""Military Personnel"" drink to much, unlike their civilian counterparts who are more mature? Right! So as far as this CW3 Retired, two tours Vietnam veteran is concerned your Grand Opening of the ""Brass Rail"" doesn't do justice to the memories I and others have of it being a rea room in a class establishment.",2016-03-02T22:56:54+0000,10153872254547787_10153902411117787,817596388269509,0

Although the exchange offers diesel and E85 fuel at some exchanges, diesel sales compared to regular fuel at those locations only yields 2% of total sales. There must be a demand to justify the expense of adding diesel tanks and dispensers to locations.

Last year a traffic study was done on the traffic on and around post. There has been no observable difference in traffic, however. The light at MacArthur and Reece and the lights at Cooper and Reece are incredibly too long, causing large back ups. The lights do not change in duration at times of less traffic, either. The best thing to happen to traffic on post was when the lights were INOP and blinking, allowing drivers to use their own discretion at the intersection. What is being done to alleviate the traffic concerns on post? Also, has it been considered to make a few of the traffic lights on post into blinking yellow/red, instead of timed traffic lights?",2016-01-20T23:11:09+0000,10153817532717787_10153820030032787,10204005513720370,1

We were waiting to deploy to Iraq, Monica Wallis. And this guy (your husband now) went out of his way to give each and every one of us one of those cheesy Valentine's Day cards we used to hand out in grade school.  I was not even part of that unit.  I was cross-leveled.  He did not know me at all. To this day, I still remember that kind gesture. Such a great, compassionate guy,which is often difficult to be in that/this line of work.   I hope you have a very happy Thanksgiving; but moreso, that every day is an adventure and a blessing. And that you both remain safe, because I know you are stationed in some very remote and austere conditions at times.",2015-11-26T13:19:47+0000,10153716908552787_10153718224627787,929059207108688,1

The cessation of the conflict went into effect on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918. Now, it's November 8. Or November 7. Or whatever November  day is convenient.  Honor, bravery, tradition, it's gone by the wayside in this country. And it's a real shame, because there was a time where a 10-year-old kid could stand along side his father, a World War II Veteran, and salute as the Doughboys of World War I proudly marched behind the Stars and Stripes.

Attention MARC Penn Line Passengers

Northbound trains depart Union Station at 6:32am, 7:00am, 7:40am, and 8:00amand each arrival will be met by a bus. In the evening, buses will depart Odenton Station at 3:40pm, 4:25pm, 5:10pm, and 6:05pm for a return trip to Savage and transfer to southbound Camden Line trains.  The Fort Meade MARC Shuttle Bus will operate as usual from Odenton Station.

Some of the parents might not have really been there for the kids but all the children had a good time it seemed. It's only two hours once a week though. Last year it snowed from November to April. And it's not aways safe or feasible to play out in the snow, especially those parents with babies and toddlers. 
It would be ideal to have an indoor playground. Kids can't climb at home and there isn't any climbing equipment at romp n stomp or at any of the community centers and the gym pool isn't well heated or child friendly. There are several abandoned buildings all over this post and Corvias has plenty of money to make an indoor playground if only the garrison would ask. We'd happily pay a dollar to play indoors.

As I sat on 175 this morning to make a left onto post at the Reece Gate (after 3 light cycles) I noticed the reason it gets backed up so bad is because traffic crossing over 175 blocks people from making a left when the light changes. This is a simple and easy fix. Currently to cross 175 on Reece the light gives the left turn signal, then the all green. If you reverse this, green to cross straight, then green for left. This will give the vehicles crossing time to move up so people on 175 can make the left. Getting 5 or 6 cars more each light cycle, while keeping the light cycle times the same can save time, and we all know how time is money.",2014-10-31T18:16:40+0000,10152893843777787_10152899079997787,10153099851712904,0

They now have such an extensive check system they are no longer providing 60% of the programs they used to have. A standalone VBS was unable to get enough volunteers to run here at all so it is now a family VBS an hour before chapel so parents watch the kids.

6879,80128057786_10152653853067787,"I recently had an experience where I had to get my CAC pin reset.  I decided to do a ""Walk In"" on a Friday morning and arrived at 0800 to find a packed house and about 20 people still waiting in line to check in.   A lady came and informed everyone that their systems were down and they were doing everything possible to get them back up.  She said that in spite of the outage, at 0900 they would have to focus on people that made appointments and would only be able to fit ""walk-ins"" in in slots where appointments were canceled.   She did offer other possible locations to seek service.   -------->   You would not believe how some customers started having ""temper tantrums"".  And the whole time the employees have to put up with it.   People should know that the employees there do not control their systems.  Everything to get them repaired must be done remotely.  They employees just have to wait on that support just like the customers.  ONE LAST THING...  People that show up during walk-in hours for an ID card that is expiring within a week are just irresponsible.   If they do not plan ahead and make an appointment to take care of this, they can only blame themselves.  One person's self-inflicted emergency does not constitute one for everyone else. And it sure as heck does not warrant canceling the appointment of someone who thought ahead just so that person's ""emergency"" can be handled.  <----  Was that a rant?  Nope, just a fellow ""customers"" unbiased view of the situation.",2014-06-30T14:45:53+0000,10152653853067787_10152654008327787,505283389632254,4

Sounds so much more efficient... 

Not to mention the security risk.  All it would take is one military member or dependent to be jumped somewhere by someone who wants to do harm on base (muggings, robberies, and car jackings are common, and especially thanks to Snowdon and etc it's not like this place is super popular right now)... Put  a gun  to their side, and told to drive onto base.  Their id and access code will get them on, and it's not like the keypad will notice the bad guy....

Or a teenager giving their ID and code to a buddy, so they can come over without a problem...

She acted annoyed at taking care of me and refused to hand me my purchase when done. After asking her to give it to me she refused and walked away from the register. The folks there are usually pretty nice but there are times when the customer service is pretty poor.  This time the cashier was down right rude.  I hope the manager review the camera tape.  I think some of the workers need some serious customer service training. Will definitely lodge a complaint with the new store manager.

As you can hear outside Mother Nature is hitting us hard with wind gusts as the temps fall. 

Many Secondary streets are ice covered. Even those that have been plowed. 

Ice covered power lines mixed with strong wind gusts mean power outages are likely. The good news is the snow drifts are less likely due to the ice that has formed on top - The down side is the weight of the snow while shoveling. 

We mentioned earlier that many deaths are attributed to the cold while mixed with the added physical stress of shoveling snow. These Heart Attacks happen at the worst time - Delays from 911 crews because of snow covered or ice packed streets are likely. So don't push it.

WATCH essentially means a ?chance? this condition will happen and usually covers a large geographical area for a lengthy time period.

WARNING means the said weather is already occurring or is likely to occur and to take proper protective measures. Warnings are usually issued for much smaller geographical areas and usually for shorter more definite time periods.

ADVISORIES are sort of in between a WATCH and WARNING. The expected weather condition has a pretty good chance of occurring, even a likely chance of occurring, but typically an advisory is used for ?less? severe type of weather conditions. A Wind Advisory might be issued or a Freezing Rain Advisory issued instead of a High Wind Warning or an ice Storm Warning.

It's sad to see this is what our military folks have to deal with at the Commissary. The management is not blind to the issues. I've spoken to two of the managers since arriving here last year and still ZERO improvement has been made.

I would believe that all commands would desire to have properly working registers, card swipe machines that work and that are not broken in any way.

9504,80128057786_10152177926307787,"I have been in contact with the Fort Meade POlice about the dangerous conditions of the Reece Rd/ MacArthur Rd intersection. With the left turn signal from MacARthur to Reece without a left turn lane, cars pull out from behind , crossing a DOUBLE SOLID LINE to turn. Last week I was make a legal right on red from Reece to MacArthur and was missed by inches of being hit head on, by a car that pulled out from behind the lead car not turning.  I was taught crossing a double yellow line is against the law, but people continue to do it. Cones were set in place and removed, set in place again after I questioned them being removed and they were removed again. The answer I received was 'turning off the arrow requires money"" and that a plan to restrict the left turn is being worked on but requires money. 
So a persons life is not important enough to do something to prevent what could be a bad situation. This is a safety issue (in my opinion), and should never be a money issue I thought Fort Meade was all about being safe. It will be a very sad day , when an innocent person is hurt or worse because the right thing could not be done to prevent it first.",2013-10-29T14:58:10+0000,10152177926307787_9703654,10152578037901464,0

Jeff, being a former MP does not make you an expert nor does it anoint you the installation Enforcement Czar. In fact, you questioning the rationale behind wearing high-visibility vests while conducting ""step out"" traffic enforcement proves you know little about the threats posed to LEO's working roadside -- especially LEO's wearing ACU clothing specifically designed to be hard to see. The tactical advantages gained by not wearing a vest are offset by its dangers. Traffic enforcement around the entry points effectively promote public safety. If you saw the traffic studies that show the cluster of accidents that occur around access points you probably wouldn't be as critical. 

Secondly, if a violator is inclined to flee, the presence of a vest will have little impact on their decision to do so. And merely because our Director is not required by regulation to obscure a Soldier's name doesn't mean that courtesy cannot be extended if he deemed it appropriate. The most dangerous place in our country, is not the inner city, it is the American highway.

As a parent, you hold the responsibility of making the ultimate decision concerning your child. The State of Maryland does not provide us with an age children must reach before they can be left alone. The Unattended Children?s Law states a person who is charged with the care of a child (ren) under the age of 8 may not allow the child to be locked or confined in a dwelling, building, enclosure, or motor vehicle while the person is absent and the dwelling, building, enclosure, or motor vehicle is out of the sight of the person charged unless the person charged provides a reliable person at least 13 years of age to remain with the child to protect the child. Also, the child neglect law requires that children under the age of 18 receive supervision appropriate to their age and development.

As parents, you must make the best decision to ensure that your child is safe and secure.",2013-05-20T19:55:15+0000,10151889094462787_26111406,10101080019469425,1

11251,80128057786_10151840991842787,"I just did the survey and in no field where any of the above mentioned topics closely touched.
KACC supposed to provide customer service and we the CUSTOMER don't receive service that is satisfactory. This is the issues you should focus on and maybe the issue with missed appointments will fix itself?
1. Parking! Please have a designated staff parking lot so we the customer can actually make it to the appointments without waiting 30+min for a parking slot to open. Most of the vehicles ( after 5! Hours visit to KACC for well baby app and pharmacy incl. parking spot search) haven't even moved! 
2. The long waiting line on the appointment line is not acceptable if anybody answers at all. During certain hours you don't even reach a person ( close to lunch time 10.45am and close to end of the day 3.30pm) 
3. The attitude of your appointment line staff is very ' not customer service friendly' when somebody ask you why it takes 6 weeks for a well baby appointment all we want to hear is a good reason/explanation and not listen to a frustrated attitude "" because that's how it is. I don't control it i just make those appointments. take it or leave it""
4. Well baby appointments take 4+weeks ( average 6 weeks) to schedule but the appointment itself is barely 20min.... That is a very sad cut. 
5. Pharmacy... Do I need to say more? 3 1/2 hour waiting time is on no planet in this solar system acceptable.
6. Handouts are out dated, wrong phone number, wrong department etc. 
And I am pretty sure if you care to ask your customers, there ate plenty more that could be done better. If we the customer are being taking serious, being listen to and provided with a satisfactory service. Maybe just maybe the issue KACC has with its customer wouldn't be as evident.",2013-04-17T19:09:01+0000,10151840991842787_25725707,10205256355673110,5

This meeting will give those residents a chance to learn about the program. Additionally,

However, other agencies may determine to develop separate plans for these facilities, since Federal offices in areas outside the Capital Beltway may be subject to different weather and traffic conditions than those inside the Beltway.  In very rare circumstances, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may issue guidelines affecting agency facilities outside the Washington Capital Beltway.  Note, however, that 
OPM?s procedures do not apply to employees of the legislative branch, judicial branch, U.S. Postal Service, the government of the District of Columbia, or private sector entities, including contractors.

 The Garrison Commander has made this decision after considering the severity of conditions predicted for tomorrow, local school closures and a decision by the Office of Personnel Management to close federal offices in the D.C. Area.
 Only Emergency Essential Garrison employees will report for work. Employees of other Belvoir agencies should check with their own supervisors if they are unsure of their duty status.
 CYSS patrons who have previously completed the Emergency Essential designation paperwork, have been assigned a Family Child Care provider to take care of their children in emergency situations. Emergency Essential patrons should therefore take their children to that designated provider. CYSS will be sending a courtesy email to Emergency Essential patrons reminding them of their designated Family Child Care provider's name and contact information.
 Fort Belvoir?s Visitor Processing Operations Center is closed. All DFMWR facilities are closed.
 Some AAFES facilities will close early Monday. Schedules will be posted as they are available.
 For questions concerning Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, contact the information desk directly at 571-231-3224.

It was a cold January night and the arrival time kept changing, but we were all waiting patiently out in the cold.  An announcer came over the loud speaker and told us their flight had landed and they were boarding busses.  The crowd went wild.  Over then next hour we received many more updates as to the progress of their journey to the parade field with each announcement the cheers got louder.  By the time the busses rolled in we could hardly stand to wait.  But we waited.  The busses parked on the far side of the field and when the troops rolled out into formation all we could see were there marching feet.  By this point everyone in the bleachers were on their feet and cheering...the screams got louder as the first of the troops crossed over to our side of the field.  There was a brief speech giving us just enough time to scan the rows and rows of troops and find our soldier, and then they were released and everyone ran to their troop.

If you did not notice none of the military personnel that took over were even armed. It is only a temporary solution until they can hire enough DASG's ( which most are Veterans)   Many of the former security officers  like myself ( Marines) were prior service members-- and some were currently still active reservists.

I've noticed a ""trend"" in that past year or two. That the soldiers are being used as examples over the smallest of (I wouldn't even call them of offensive) mistakes. And I'm talking good soldiers being beat down by their command. Some should have been given a verbal counseling. But they get reduced in rank and article 15. Many soldier feel like they are being abused or even hazed (mind you not physically over minor things). Makes me wonder is it because the Army wants over 40,000 troops out and the chain of command was given the orders to kick anyone out? So they make a soldier suffer till the command is satisfied or till discharge? But a very few never makes it that far because they commited suicide since they have no one to turn to. It's kinda hard to admit to wanting to commite suicide. And I know this for a facted since its happened to me. There's so much I REALLY want to say here. But I strongly urge the chain of command to think about the soldier 1st and how much is too much when it comes to punish over the smallest thing. Sorry it's hard for me to rewrite from my previous post. Just think about the soldier who committed suicide because the chain of command wanted to make an ""example out of them"" for something that could have simply done with a verbal. I know some deserve it but many of them don't. ",2012-09-19T15:45:17+0000,470272616340847_95959045,747136011997085,1

13419,80128057786_10151510269197787,"The following is a news release from the Anne Arundel County Police Department: 

""On September 18, 2012, at approximately 7:50 a.m., an unnamed parent called MacArthur Middle School and spoke with an Assistant Principal about observations he/she saw at a bus stop.  The witness indicated he/she saw a 13-year-old male student with what appeared to be a BB gun in the waist band of the student?s pants.  The witness did not call police with this information, and the witness was specific in identifying the item as a BB gun to school officials. School administrators greeted the bus when it arrived at school and contacted both County Police and their Office of School Security.

All students were immediately removed from the bus and several male students were escorted inside for interviews.  During the course of the investigation, the 13-year-old male student who had the BB gun at the bus stop was identified.  Possession of this type of item on a school bus and/or school property is a violation of the Anne Arundel County Public Schools? Code of Student Conduct and was being initially being investigated as an AACPS disciplinary infraction.  The student relinquished the BB gun to school administrators, but during a search of his belongings, a large knife with a blade of approximately seven inches was found in the student?s backpack.  Upon discovering this weapon, the School Resource Officer (SRO) assigned to MacArthur Middle School assumed responsibility for a criminal investigation.       

The investigation determined the suspect student discharged the BB gun while at the bus stop, striking another 13-year-old male student in the leg.  This reportedly occurred before the adult witness saw the student with the BB gun.  The victim?s injury was minor in nature and did not require medical treatment.  The 13-year-old male student from Laurel, Maryland was charged on a juvenile citation with possessing a dangerous weapon on school property, 2nd degree assault and reckless endangerment.  He was later released to his parent/guardian.""",2012-09-18T20:56:31+0000,10151510269197787_23444025,80128057786,0

C'mon, Allison Bourg, you're not even trying. Only the Army has Soldiers. So there are 12,000 SERVICE MEMBERS, from all five branches of the military stationed at Fort Meade.

If there were service members from each branch that took their life, than your headline is is completely misleading.

Remember: 
Army = Soldier
Air Force = Airmen
Marines = Marines
Navy = Sailors",2012-09-14T16:34:34+0000,282512481858361_1360406,10152685892698935,7

Besides, the thesaurus is the wrong refrence book for this story. The proper reference is the AP Style Guide, which states:

""Do not describe Marines as soldiers, which is generally associated with the Army. Use 'troops' if a generic term is needed."" The same applies for each branch of service.

The point is, that when one lumps all service members together in story such as this, it implies the suicide problem in the Army is worse than it is and leaves a false impression in the reader's mind.

Have you heard of the joe wants to know webpage? It's a huge hit in the military community and very helpful for those who use it! It's basically an ongoing, more casual Townhall meeting. I know there are several groups on Facebook for spouses and families to join, however this is kind of a public affairs thing, where the information that is given out by the page is considered to be accurate information instead of heresay and experience-based information. This area is so big, and supports many military facilities and missions- I bet it would be very beneficial to have something like it.

On the other hand, this page has been amazing for answering questions and connecting to resources. I wonder if it would be possible to add a discussion page where people could address their questions. This allows room for regulating comments, of course, and questions that are helpful toward everyone such as ""What are the commissary hours on holidays?"" could be left up for future residents to access when needed.

14119,80128057786_10150646713632787,"Erica, the tickets were given to Fort Meade from the Department of the Army to be distributed to Soldiers and their family members. Typically, the White House holds a certain number of Easter Egg Roll tickets aside for military service members and their families that are unable to get tickets through the public online lottery system. The White House works with each service to distribute the tickets. We were only contacted by the Department of the Army to distribute a few of their Army-specific tickets (50). The e-mail about the limited tickets was sent to public affairs professionals and senior enlisted leaders of Fort Meade units with Army Soldiers. How and when the information was distributed to Soldiers in each unit was at the units? discretion. We used the voicemail system in order to make the process as fair as possible. With such a limited number of tickets (50), and so many Soldiers, there is no completely fair way, but with other high-level events in the past the voicemail system seems to work the best. We returned all calls received between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and unfortunately, the slots were filled in the first couple of minutes. We know it?s hard to believe, but with such few tickets (50) and so many Soldiers and family members here at Fort Meade, the tickets really did go that quickly. Each opportunity and the way we publicize it depends on the specifications of that opportunity, but please know that we do everything in our power to communicate the opportunities to the impacted audiences in the fairest way possible so that our service members and their families can benefit from these experiences.",2012-04-08T20:33:35+0000,10150646713632787_21662911,80128057786,2
