40,169018434110_10154582276634111,"It's nice to see the Depot finally coming out of the Dark Ages supporting the Trades instead of completly focusing on electronics.Personally I feel you can get a job anywhere in the country or the world for that matter faster than you can in any electronics field.That said,I would like to point out that it is fantastic getting these state of the art welding machines.Miller was my personal favorite for Tig when I was welding and loved Lincoln better than Hobart when it came to stick welding.I used them in shipyard and Nuclear plants before ever coming to the Depot.Welding was my first love and when work got slow they put me in electronics which I hated because I was only an WG8(28Yrs) because of 2 supervisors in that shop who pretended they knew welding and when I called them on it they would get frustrated,LOL! My purpose in writing this is not because of my misfortunes in the weld shop because I am So Happy to be retired and away from certain supervision.I would like to suggest though,that even though the weld shop is getting these new machines,money should be spent sending alot of these so called welders to a reputable school where they can get a solid foundation in Welding.When I was there only a handful of us had completed an accredited welding school and believe me we were so much better than the rest that learned on their own or took advise from people that didn't know what the heck they were doing in the first place.I called them stick-um welders.You can have the best machines going but if you don't know how to control the puddle or what to look for why appling the weld or what to do after the initial weld (root pass and hot pass or the HAZ(Heat affected zone to name a few),no machine will help you.Remember you have to pass visual before anything and don't forget,the Best Inspector on the job is the welder doing the welder because he should know if it's good or bad.Invest in your welders(on the outside) and you will have a great team who can compare with anyone.Don;t do that and I guarantee it will show.Remember,where two pieces of metal have to be joined,you'll find a GOOD WELDER!",2016-10-18T02:31:01+0000,10154582276634111_10154658363199111,951358958224120,1

Lockheed Martin MST does not recognize your ISO certification because the registrar is not an accredited member of the IAF.

You may want to look for an alternate organization that is accredited with the IAF for this ISO certification.

Daryl,

We agree that things aren?t fair, however its what our customer wants and at the end of the day if the customer isn?t happy the customer is no longer a customer.

Barb

The employee who - sweeps and runs the machines many times has the chutzpah the supposed owner doesn't - as illustrated in the above correspondence.

The owners of many companies are not leaders as demonstrated by LOCKHEED'S shakedown -sitting on the IAF (International Accreditation Forums-board) as a voting member on policy
Where is the leadership- shouldn't a business owner have the right to choose the registrar of choice rather than the one LOCKHEED SITS ON THE BOARD OF- ANSI-ANAB -ITS SISTER COMPANY IAF ( ANSI - ANAB)? AND MAKES POLICY OY - VEY- by LOCKHEED sitting on the board of the IAF the international accreditation forum-

 Basically, LOCKHEED suppliers pay the $45,000 per registration scheme(to ANSI- ANAB)  ( ISO 9001. AS 9100, TS 16949, ISO 13485 = ($180,000 K  x 90 -120 registrars- (Fee Schedule for Accreditation Programs for
Management Systems Certification Bodies ref FM 5300 pg 4 of 4    (http://aboac.org/FM5300.pdf )to utilize the ANSI -ANAB logo for each registration scheme THIS is the entry FEE to get into the IAF.
It's  a shakedown from the 1930s what LOCKHEED and other aerospace companies do. 
Is Lockheed's quality any better? from being a voting  on policy- member on the INTERNATIONAL ACCREDITATION FORUMS (IAF)  BOARD the sister company of ANSI-ANAB the accreditation body looking at them and their subcontractors
