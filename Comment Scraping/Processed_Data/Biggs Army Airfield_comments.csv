202,178524104062_10154419981084063,"Why over think this? I concur with keeping the sleeves down, but factually, when the Army wore OG 107s we just rolled them up in garrison and there was no need for the ?camo out? kabuki dance. It wasn?t about looking like Marines, or was it to produce a more ?professional? appearance. Rolling sleeves was for pragmatics and the method used was IAW the KISS principle. The BDU ?camo out? complication in rolling up sleeves was just too complicated. Why do we have to keep making the same mistakes repeatedly? You want to improve morale then work harder to stop the erosion of military service benefits for service members and their families. Stop destroying the pension program, education, and medical benefits. Fix transition programs like ACAP and the MMRB, MEB, and PEB process. You want to make a uniform change that really helps then get rid of the PT belt! Rolling sleeves was never a benefit for Infantrymen or any warriors and is not pragmatic with the current combat uniforms. These combat uniforms are not designed to accommodate this unnecessary option. RLTW!",2016-06-22T17:51:20+0000,10154419981084063_10154420163339063,664274460325201,4

Too many bright young soldiers, with unlimited potential, are treated so badly by their superiors.. and are not given the support and guidance they need. They are disillusioned and end up hating their time in service, and can't wait to get out. Therefore, never reaching their full potential of what they could gain, and what they can provide in service to the country. My son is one of those.. he always wanted to be a soldier, and went in with enthusiasm and hopes of making the military his lifelong career. Now, after only 3 years in, he is angry, unfulfilled, and is counting the days till he can get out. This is a terrible shame. The leadership that he should be able to look to for guidance and inspiration, instead seems impatient, uninterested and condescending toward the young soldiers they are supposed to be encouraging and helping to build into exemplary examples of an American soldier.

I'm sure hallways are filled with such stories and I would use my experience as a counseling example to those needing a different direction.

So I have to put my personal needs on the back burner for my personal wants. Before you all start with this bs about kick them all out and they shouldn't be in the army, maybe just maybe we should look at what makes someone non-deployable and change the system.

710,178524104062_10153844051419063,"Part of the problem is the culture of the Army and the carrot on a stick mentality in our recruitment. We dont need to offer recruits so much to join. We need to offer them a life adventure and changing experience.  Most of my young EM had the same complaint: misconception of the Army experience compared to what they saw on TV. Gone are the historic, wooden barracks, and salty NCOs with their colorful language. This is what many of them sought. Instead they found a corporate, liberal, GLBT croud , and an AR full of regs and a path to early medical retirement with college benefits. 

If we raised our standards and offered some mystique to our military experience we would have a line out the door I honestly believe. Look at the USMC.

While a junior EM in the Infantry I got sick and tired of hearing guys say they joined for the benefits.  It occurred to me then we shouldn't offer ANY for the first enlistment. When a soldier RE-UPs then give them the benefits.......and judiciously send them to the sexy schools ie BAC, air assault,  Ranger, Sapper, so they can get tabbed out and have the adventure they crave.

Yes enlistment would go down for a few years. But we're downsizing anyway. However when word got out of our new combat, warrior focused culture kids would come seeking escape from our meek, PC society.

But first we need to get rid of those nondeployable soldiers, and the leadership that created the environment that attracts and sustains them.

I say conduct an APFT today Army wide. No preperation. If you dont pass 70% in the 17-21 age group (no matter your age. I could at 50) then you're out today. No makeup. No profile. No mercy. You're done.

857,178524104062_10153734388654063,"I wish I could give this a big two thumbs up, but I can't. Here is why: 
- Army professional development isn't...it is a continuous rehash of the same information. I have completed ALC and haven't been exposed to anything new at any level. How many times do I have to be trained on sexual harassment? If a soldier hasn't figured it out by the time they complete basic, then they're not compatible with the military. 
- I haven't seen any actual ""leadership"" training yet. I confronted the Sergeant Major at the completion of ALC about this, and got the ""deer in the headlights look""! I tried to explain that I want someone to teach us how to be good, inspiring, moral, and persuasive leaders. He didn't understand. So I explained that I look back at all the people I have worked for (the ones I would follow to hell and back), and I try to emulate the best aspects of them. Then I look back at the worst ones (the ones I would drive past if I saw them broke down on the side of the road), and I try to avoid their behavior. He grew more frustrated, and wouldn't sign my 1059 (he was too busy on a video conference call...everyone else got theirs though), I was stuck there for another 7 hours before they let me leave then it took 3 weeks to get my 1059. Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut.
- the new rules forcing NCO's to complete the next level schools prior to being eligible for promotion (as it was explained to us this past weekend) is nothing more than a ploy to further stress morale, and attempt to diminish our devoted military.
- our warrior culture is being administratively trampled out, and we are becoming a force of bean counting, desk jockey, cry babies that are being taught to mindlessly accept this new softer Army...all while the world burns around us.

PT should be uninterrupted. 1SGs should not be letting anything happen during that time that doesn't have to do with breaking a sweat.

1314,178524104062_10153112730314063,""" The commission's recommendations are based in part on an extensive survey of thousands of active-duty troops conducted last year to identify which types of compensation troops most prefer.""
---I highly doubt that.

""Specifically, the proposal calls for automatically enrolling each service member in the federal government's Thrift Savings Plan, or TSP, an investment account that accrues savings. Individual troops will be responsible for managing their accounts, and the money is typically not available for withdrawal without penalty until age 59.5.""
---A 401(k) which the government already doesn't match like many employers, this is basically telling us to pay for our own retirement.  Retirement is part of our pay and compensation, I don't see them raising the pay.

"" The plan also calls for the Pentagon to create a new four-star medical command to oversee the Pentagon's sprawling health care system. ""
---Completely unnecessary.  Sister services already work together in joint military medical facilities.  This is just a way to open up more command positions.  You don't save money by adding commands.  You save money by not divvying out profitable pork contracts for things we don't need, like the Abrams, C-27Js, and VH-71.

"" A grandfather clause would shield today's service members from any retirement changes; a new retirement system would apply only to future recruits."" 
---The VFW and American Legion still lobby for the military, and anyone who would take the stance ""Well it will only affect the new recruits"" should think about what military leadership means.",2015-01-28T05:14:42+0000,10153112730314063_10153113127524063,10204213194905395,2

Simply put another signature block for a 1SG/CSM after the senior rater as proof the company has verified all data. I found that lots of 1SGs were having the same problem in their larger companies with staff members stretched across the country side or around the world and was fixed with policy letters, but one additional block on the NCOER could fix an issue that many may not be aware of.",2014-09-20T15:18:25+0000,10152766313099063_10152766374354063,869053846438699,8

A statement he made really hit home for me. I quote,""I do not want people that work for me to be afraid of making a mistake, if you are  afraid of making mistakes you will be afraid of making decisions, and if you are afraid of making a decision you are no good to me as a leader. He went on to say 90% of what he knew came from making mistakes, you just don't make the same mistake twice!

I always believed in letting a Sqd Ldr lead his squad. Give him his mission let him go with it, you can coach, make suggestions etc but let him run his squad. Sometimes you may have to call him aside and give advice, but never take over his squad! Unless of course he is doing something that may cause bodily harm or injuries.

NCOs should be addressing this and other issues consistently during training and developmental counseling.

2146,178524104062_10151649342454063,"Having served in the US Army Recruiting Command for 19 of my 25 plus years I can agree with that feedback to an extent.  During the decade plus years of high optempo of executing OIF and OEF, which became increasingly unpopular required enlistment standards to become waiverable to meet end strength requirements.  Great men and women stepped up to embrace the call to duty when others looked the other way.  All served this great nation and some gave their all.  Too many!  Can we do a better job of screening applicants?  I'm sure we can and the question demands a comprehensive staff review of current policy.  However predetermining whether a Soldier will cross the line of integrity and violate the trust bestowed in them or more importantly that of their fellow Soldier or those whom they may lead is a daunting challenge.  I submit that a culture change is in fact what is needed.  On this point I completely agree.  It must start with enlistment standards and indoctrination (more so that currently exists) of values, standards expectation, discipline, and unwavering trust in fellow Soldiers and leaders.  Especially in leaders that they will listen and take appropriate and immediate actions as established by law and UCMJ.  Soldiers must trust that they can report incidents without fear of reprisal or harassment.  I charge NCOs to become more involved with those in their charge and make values based training a constant discussion and validate that their Soldiers know that violation of Army values, trust, and the rule of law will not be tolerated.  Current DoD and Army policy and UCMJ will be revised and chain teaching will follow, however I believe we must make this type of training, critical as it and other such requirements become an enduring part of any/all institutional training.  Where POIs do exists, review and improve!!  As we move forward to opening more of our combat  MOSs to female Soldiers we absolutely MUST get this right!!  America will not trust their sons and daughters to serve in the best and most professional armed forces in the world if we fail at this!!  I do not pretend to have the solution and believe that the comprehensive Army Staff Study that must occur should consider all viable courses of action that pass the common sense test.  I stress again the importance of NCOs taking point.  Hooah.",2013-06-05T22:08:22+0000,10151649342454063_10426049,10204875345791412,1

I then met the publisher at the Academy where we laid out the last pages and sent them to the print facility.  I will never forget the people that I worked with on this committee.

Also pictured is his wife Marilyn, who has been incredibly supportive of the academy and her husband. Before the orders were posted, USASMA Commandant Command Sgt. Maj. Rory Malloy, took a few minutes to talk about Jergens who served under Malloy as a medic when the two were deployed with the 1st Cav.  Malloy recalled how Jergens made things happen in a mere three weeks when Malloy sought him out for his expertise on what to do to get more immediate medical attention and supplies in place and train average Soldiers to give that immediate care for those wounded in battle. The commandant stopped briefly when recollecting how he was the one who had to deliver news to Jergens that his son Brian, had sustained serious injuries from an IED blast and lost both his legs. ""It was tough,"" said Malloy. Jergens was working in the Battle Staff Course and recalled the outpouring of support from his coworkers. ""My Battle Staff buddies are a phenomenal group. They stood beside me every day and helped me get through this tragedy,"" he said, ""And so did my wife, Marilyn. You don't do these things alone.""

Integrity is by Army definition ""Do what is right, legally and morally."" And also, do the right thing even if no one is watching. That is a part of what having self discipline is. I've seen many so called NCO's with ""integrity"" who have had no self discipline what-so-ever. A E7 in my unit was cheating on his wife with an E4... but the leadership in our unit still though this person to have good integrity. It just doesn't work that way.

3483,178524104062_10150168763389063,"I am an alumni of USASMA (Class 12, 1979).  A few years later I was Chief of the NCOES Branch of what was then called MILPERCEN.

in that capacity I visited each class when I brought the post-graduation assignments to the students; every six months for several years. 

Each time I visited I was so very proud to be a graduate of USASMA.  I often wondered how far USASMA would go. I had high Expectations of course - but in my wildest dreams I never imagined how wonderful USASMA would become some 30+ years after my graduation. 

I salute every who stuck with the dream senior NCOs had back in the 70's of the ULTIMATE NCO education system .   USASMA meant so much to us ""old soldiers""; and I am honored, impressed, and breathless with the hard work and creativity that went into making USASMA the great pinnacle of NCO education it is today. 

I thank you for what you have done, and I applaud your achievements.

The Army has moved to what they call ""Strategic Communications"" which is another word for the ""Army Message"" however the overtones of political correctness tend to warp the intended message. Clear communication - the very definition of it- contiues to get lost and junior NCO's and Soldioers look at their NCO leaders as talking heads rather than Trusted Leaders.

3616,178524104062_106942615991186,"Herb/Brett: Good questions, I'm glad you gentlemen are reading and really thinking about it.
It means we're moving further away from a primarily training focus and incorporating a more educational base. The latter means ""Enhancing Enlisted Education"" by developing curriculum that better prepares NCOs as analytical thinkers capable of providing battlefield counsel to commanders across a broad range of issues -- more strategic in nature. Not just tactical or task based support.
To use another example you'll see here often: We want to develop a broadly-skilled NCO who is agile, a critical and creative thinker, and a leader developer -- among other things.
So we're bringing in top-notch staff and faculty, plus building up curriculum in support of that focus. When we talk high-end curriculum, we mean that which taxes the high end of the student?s cognitive domain. We also have more sergeants major with master?s degrees on board as instructors to help do that. 
And by the way, that's also how we'll ensure coursework is accredited and, in the end, leads USASMA to becoming a degree-granting institution. 
True, we've always trained, and to some extent, educated our Soldiers; we're just upping the ante so to speak with regards to the educational portion. 
Herb: The little ""one-liners"" are known as teasers in the PR game, and are meant to get folks to think a bit, ask questions and dig for more information --- like you did. There's no reason to apologize for asking a good question. In fact, we're taking partial credit for you asking them, as the academy must have taught you well. 
Since Facebook isn't the best medium for a micro look at these changes, try visiting the USASMA public web site for details as to curriculum and the changes we?re pursuing: https://usasma.bliss.army.mil

You need to show us 5 or 6 of the courses and tell us exactly how this is going to be used to the soldier's benefit. There is so much political correctness around these days that I wonder if the courses come up from the staff and the troops. or down from some social scientist. I also think you should push papers, papers, papers. Anyone can prep for a test (I used a hundred index cards which I had to go through perfectly every night), but the ability to write a paper on a subject requires a lot of thought and research.
