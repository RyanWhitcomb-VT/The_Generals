415,408185632542621_1017320054962506,"On the subject of ""Advanced Careers at YPG"", I would like to add my two cents. Because YPG helped me with my career. 
     While I was attending Kofa High, as well as Arizona Western College, I was gearing my future towards Radio Broadcasting, specifically Broadcast Engineering. I took all of the electronics courses Kofa and AWC had to offer as well as the Radio Broadcasting courses and even worked six nights a week at a local radio station. 
     Then, in 1977, my final year at AWC, I was given the opportunity of a life-time with the work-study program with YPG. The work-study program provided me with a Student/Trainee position as a technician in the Velocity & Ballistics Instrumentation group at KOFA Firing range. I got to work with electronics, pressure sensors, strain gauges, optics, Radar, and best of all I got to be around the artillery. The big guns were exciting to me. 
     The work-study program was only for that year, beginning early January and ending late December. At the conclusion of my  internship, I tried my darnedest to get a permanent position with YPG. Unfortunately, my applications were not accepted, and shortly after stint at YPG, I went back into the Radio business. 
     About a year and a half later, I was told about a job opening for an Instrumentation Technician at YPG. But this was not a job working for the U.S. Army, it was a job at the Castle Dome Helipad on the northern edge of the KOFA Firing Range, with Hughes Helicopters. 
     In Aug 1979, I was hired by Hughes Helicopters, and began working with the Instrumentation equipment that was being used to test the YAH-64, the early prototype of the AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter. 
     In January of 2013, after 33 1/2 years, I retired and walked out of the hanger where we, myself and my co-workers, were installing and calibrating the latest instrumentation equipment in the latest version of the Apache, the AH-64E Longbow Guardian.
It was a rewarding and challenging career, and I still believe that my year working at YPG had a large part of making it possible.",2015-04-17T02:22:29+0000,1017320054962506_1017397621621416,10202593832719719,3

582,408185632542621_849210538440126,"There is alot of expertise and Airborne Test Force is awesome.  This payload is rigged on a type five platform that comes in two foot pannels to get the size plattform needed for a payload.  It is designed to fit in all cargo aircraft depending on the weight.  The weight tubs have slots to put in weights to simulate the weight of an item and allows for adjusting the CG (center of gravity) of the load simulated.  There is honeycomb that is made from cardboard paper that is used to absorb the G forces during impact. This reduces and prevents damage to the payload.  forwad and aft restraint kevelar is used to restrain the load for both exiting the aircraft and landing.  typically there is a statice drop test requirement prior to acutal airdrop to determine rigging configruartions, from a static drop tower in which i designed and is currently being used at yuma proving ground, located outside the rigging bay. This is done by dropping a simulated payload or actual item from 12.6 feet 3 times to confirm rigging procedures to prevent damage. Accelerometors and instrumention is used to measure the G forces and once approved it is used to conduct the airdrop.  So you can see there is a lot of effort when conducnting an airdrop.  cant forget the parachutes used to allow approximagtely 28ft per second of decelleration that give a smooth landing .

The angles of the rock formations up there prevent that.
