 I went back to Knox last summer. The Patton museum is still there and better than it ever was. 
 The huge collection of Armored vehicles from around the world had all been moved to Ft. Benning, Ga. where they sit gathering dust indoors, unseen by the public, awaiting an appropriation from congress for money to create a display area. 
 Fort Knox is now a ghost town the size of Delaware. 
 Shut down like many other bases as a cost saving measure. 
 Did they give our troops a raise ? No. 
 Did they better provide for our Veterans ? No. 
 But we tax payers are forced to help fund illegal aliens, some of whom are here to kill us.

929,101027597230_10153255923837231,"STOLEN MILITARY BENEFIT ? Since WW II, Americans who are currently serving and their dependents have been eligible to utilize the Armed Forces Recreation Centers located in Germany. Since 1989, retirees and 100% disabled veterans and their dependents have been eligible to use these facilities. Today, only one is in operation, Edelweiss Lodge and Resort, located in Garmisch, Germany. In June 2015, a EUCOM (formally USAREUR) JAG reinterpreted the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and decided that all currently serving active and reserve component military personnel, all military retirees, all 100% disabled veterans and dependents, not assigned to or residing in EUCOM/Germany are no longer entitled to use Edelweiss, despite an official policy letter in 1989 that authorizes their use of the AFRC in Europe. The EUCOM CG accepted this reinterpretation/opinion. So, for over 25 years there has been no problem but on one opinion, our benefit vanished.  But now,  German military members, NATO military members, U.S. diplomatic officials and U.S. civilians employed by the U.S. government in EUCOM are entitled to use our facility. What an insult. A majority of U.S. military I.D. card holders are excluded while service personnel from other countries and our politicians can use our facility. Our earned benefit was stolen through an administrative decision, without the knowledge of our elected officials or considering the negative impact this has on so very many people. It does not matter whether you have ever used the AFRC in Germany or whether you will ever use it. This is simply yet another lost/stolen benefit. Since June 2015, congressmen/women and senators have been receiving letters of complaint over this loss, however, we are just now starting to see some movement in restoring our benefit. This action can easily be corrected with a change to AER 600-700 by the same EUCOM CG who denies us the use of Edelweiss. The German government did not cause this debacle, nor did the U.S. State Department.
     I am requesting that all readers of this information immediately write to your elected officials and ask them what they are personally doing to have this earned benefit returned. Some elected officials have responded in a positive manner while other have simply quoted the Edelweiss L&R eligibility criteria, which we already know. If you have not seen the new eligibility criteria, go to www.edelweisslodgeandresort.com and scroll down to ?eligibility criteria.? Be prepared for the insult.  Help us save this benefit. We are in a very critical period which will decide the fate of this benefit but we must maintain pressure on Washington.
   In this first quarter of 2016, we need many new letters of protest hitting Washington. Please complain to your congressmen/women and senators. If we let this benefit fade away quietly, what is next?",2016-02-10T21:50:15+0000,10153255923837231_10153300652077231,1216729875023089,0

They were also recorded on the historic files for the 5th Squadron, 15th Cavalry.

1133,101027597230_10153087124207231,"I served, why am I not considered a Veteran by my Government and OPM?

I have been mandated by my government to get health insurance.  I have applied for countless Federal positions?but OPM won?t give me veteran?s preference points simply because of the dates of my service don?t match their criterion and that has cost me an unknown number of employment opportunities that I need!
WHY????
Was my service substandard?  I have three different honorable discharge certificates.

Did the recreational specialist in Colorado, who never served out of country or a day in combat do something I didn?t do other than serve during ?convenient? time frames?

Why does he get the Veterans Preference Points for getting a Federal job and I don?t?

Why does my 4+ years of active duty, 5 years of National Guard and 3+ years in the Reserves count the same as a high school drop out on welfare who never wore a uniform for his country?

There are millions of us who are veterans yet get no preference simply because the dates we served weren?t convenient for OPM to recognize us for our service and give us the same preference as the hundreds of thousands who do get the preference points, but never left US soil or served a day of combat.

I served under the worst pay, didn?t get a GI bill and have no access to VA benefits.  Why are we being treated like we didn?t serve?  

Just because there was no war during our tours of duty doesn?t excuse the government and OPM from recognizing we were there and ready to answer the call.  

IF YOU SERVED, YOU SERVED!  All Veterans should be given preference when trying to find employment with the Federal Govt.

2165,101027597230_10151776588217231,"I can personally share some modern day (late 70's/early 80's) history on this particular building.  I attended basis training December 1979.  When a fresh Soldier arrived, s/he would reside in what we called the reception center.  This particular building was located in the southwest corner of this area.  Generally, Soldiers would reside in one of these barracks around 5-7 days.  They would surrender their personal clothing, get clean shaven heads, draw their field gear and a few other down and dirty tasks.  Shortly after, each Soldier would be assigned to a basic training company where the drill sergeant would perform the belittling ritual which involved packing up everything in your duffle and marching ""across the street"" to a similar barracks for another 2 months of awesome bliss.  I can attest to the authenticity of the movie ""Stripes"" with Bill Murray.  The movie actually depicted both the barracks in the reception station and the company barracks ""across the street"".  As a matter of fact, for those who remember the end of the movie when Murray marched the rag tags onto the drill and ceremony pad, my barracks were directly behind the bleachers.  For those of you who want to see some authentic barracks, WATCH THE MOVIE.  Finally, I enjoyed writing about this barracks and its significance in our Fort Knox military history.",2013-12-05T17:37:16+0000,10151776588217231_9886701,1124232560937903,5

Production Company To Transform Asphalt Road Into An 1800?s Era Dirt Road For Movie Shoot

 ELIZABETHTOWN, KY (October 28th, 2013) ?  Due to KYTC and public concerns regarding closure of KY 333 at KY 2199, the permitted event is rescheduled for this weekend.  Originally set to begin Tuesday morning and last through Thursday morning, it is now amended to begin at 2pm on Saturday and last until 3am on Monday morning.

 The closure is in the eastern corner of Breckinridge County, near the Meade and Hardin County lines and will allow crews from Antebellum Pictures to layer a dirt surface over the existing asphalt in order to create an 1861 setting for a movie shoot.

 Local residents should be aware of a signed detour that will be in effect.  Those traveling east on KY 333 from Breckinridge County will be detoured north to Bewleyville by turning right on KY 1238, right on KY 1735 and back to KY 333 to go south toward Big Springs.  Those traveling northwest on KY 220 from Hardin County heading to Breckinridge County will follow this detour route in reverse.  Mobile message boards are set up to alert motorists of the upcoming closure.

 As stated in the previous press release, emergency vehicles will be allowed to go through during the closure.

To ensure motorist safety before the roadway reopens early Monday morning, all dirt will be removed and the surface will be inspected.",2013-10-28T20:02:34+0000,10151693123837231_27200688,101027597230,0

We were not informed of this bugle call schedule when we moved in. I think that should be something we were made aware of before moving on base. I agree with Trina Norton. It is WAY too loud and way too often to hear these calls SO mamy times a day in housing. I have little ones and this scares the crap out of them in the mornings. I appreciate tradition and like that the bugle calls are done. But I think it should be focused on the duty areas and placed farther away from housing or at least turned waaaaayy down. These super early and super late calls are also not conducive to running a household with little kids.
