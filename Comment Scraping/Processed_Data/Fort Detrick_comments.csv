171,289676234440880_986918891383274,I agree with the comments that this is a great learning opportunity and to do a better job next time. By 8:00 am when most of post facilities were already open we had no reason to think there would be a further delay or reassessment about 30 minutes later. As a lot of Ft Detrick employees commute 45 minutes to an hour we were already on the road when this reassessment was made. I found out about it when I was pulling onto base with my children who attend daycare here. At that point I had a little over an hour to now wait for day care to open before they would take my kids.

484,289676234440880_905540599521104,"The policy regarding headphones/earbuds has always been in effect and is an Army policy, stated in Army Regulation 385-10, The Army Safety Program. It is spelled out in Chapter 6, Public, Family, Child, and Youth, Off-Duty Recreation, and Seasonal Safety, paragrapgh 6-5 on page 48. It reads:

?6?5. Headphones
Using portable headphones, earphones, ear, or other listening devices while walking, jogging, running, skating, skateboarding, and bicycling, including pocket bike, MC, or moped, on DOD installation roads and streets, or adjacent to roadways or roadway intersections, is prohibited.?

This is not a new regulation but is being strictly enforced and clarified due to a large amount of people not following the regulation and causing safety issues.

Headphone wearing,bicycle and skateboarding safety for Fort Detrick is spelled out in Fort Detrick Policy Memorandum 385-10-2, Non-Motorized Wheeled Vehicle Safety (attached).",2015-09-14T14:45:02+0000,905540599521104_907474755994355,289676234440880,1

597,289676234440880_825407684201063,"Jonathan, while at a conference in Gettysburg I met a gentleman that was a certified Park guide for Antietam.  He also had a Civil War Medical Museum in Maryland.  His profession was that of a dentist.  He explained to me that the inserting of the tiger in the wound was a battlefield technique.  When the young surgeon entered the Presidential booth in Ford's by climbing over the rail, since Booth had blocked the door to the booth from the inside, Lincoln was not breathing. The releasing of the blood clot with his finger relieved pressure on the brain casing Lincoln to take a long deep breathe.  Once the head army physician and other doctors got to Lincoln, they began to probe the wound with the newly developed ivory tipped probe to determine whether they were touch bone or the lead of a bullet.  They would spin the probe on the touched object and then remove it.  If the ivory was still white, they were touching bone.  If the probe camas back darkened they had hit lead.  Not that he would have survived, but the probe did much more damage than the simple finger probe.  You probably already know all of this, but thought I would tell you.",2015-04-15T04:45:23+0000,825407684201063_825771544164677,10201974611799149,0

1100,289676234440880_596729597068874,"I do understand that Fort Detrick received a LOT of snow over the last week or so.  My bone to pick is with the parking and sidewalks all over post and the roads in general.  The building I work at is 8400 Research Plaza. Behind NBACC and NIH.  We have our own road that we have to share with a LOT of construction vehicles and equipment.  So I understand why that road is gravel in one spot.  But it is HORRIBLE.  The individuals that work at 8400 are putting their vehicles on line every time we drive back there when the weather gets bad.  The pot holes are huge..and when you can't clear the path that well, they are almost invisible and now, it doesn't matter where you try to go...there are so many potholes you are ending up in them regardless.  I almost got stuck in slush due to the potholes this morning.  And the sidewalks in the parking lot...are barely cleared off except in front of our ECP and right in front of our building.  The sidewalk leading from the ECP to the front door of 8400 is HORRIBLE!  Barely cleared and salt in spots.  The only time it gets treated better is if there is a special delegation coming.  BUMED visited a few weeks ago after our initial snow falls..and it was like walking on straight salt to the door.  May have been overkill, but it was safe!  I've seen soldiers walking in the road because the sidewalks weren't dug out well.  I would think since post was closed for snow removal Feb 13 & 14 that it would be much better than it is. Understandably we got another inch or so this morning but this is EVERYTIME it snows.  Mostly I am upset with the road to our building.  Most of us don't drive SUVs or large trucks.  Is there anything that can be done for that patch of gravel?  (I know until all of the construction is complete that they likely will NOT pave back over that area).  Apologies for the rant..but this is an ongoing issue and I understand Detrick is a huge community and there is a LOT to do on post!

go over their plan. Also, be sure to remember to check the website:

1241,289676234440880_477254725683029,"Ms. Quinn, if the order to Shelter In Place is given and you are in housing,this means to choose a room in your residence for the shelter. The best room to use for the shelter is a room with as few windows and doors as possible. A large room with a water supply is best?something like a master bedroom that is connected to a bathroom will work for residents of Fort Detrick. In a closet or other storage area in the shelter room, supplies for sheltering should be used. Thank you for your question!",2013-06-10T20:42:52+0000,477254725683029_3464008,289676234440880,2
