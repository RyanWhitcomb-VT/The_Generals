Although we had gate guards there was still crime in the neighborhood from the kids who lived here. A school bus was set on fire and middle schoolers stole spray paint from the sheds of their surrounding neighbors and tagged cars and houses. There will always be something. 
The best solution would be to implement this again. Now, there will cars driving fast through raptor where people walk all the time and there children on bikes and skateboards. The speed limit of 15 is not going to be obeyed! It defeats the purpose of closing the entrance to first street considering the speed limit is 25.

Criminals are not dumb, they know what military members have in terms of personal items to include professional gear; e.g. deployment items.  They also have a perfect opportunity to sit and watch the habits of military members coming and going when the fences and gates are down,  more so than in the general pubic neighborhoods.  Bring back the security guards, put up the fences and protect those who serve to protect the country.  I'm actually amazed that a capital crime did not occur since the fences and gates were removed, e.g. a murder.  But I wonder, would that have even mattered?  You can change traffic patterns all day long, but criminals will do what they need to do to get around them as long as they have open access to the community. Put up a fence and or security guard and watch the crime drop significantly.  Just my professional opinion.",2016-09-19T11:12:31+0000,10154164808203692_10154174541553692,1468111810177484,10

Also the Wing CC, SF and all parties involved can only do so much with land that is leased and not owned by Langley. SF has no jurisdiction over this area, just a show of force until property rights are given to Langley. These steps are just the beginning, as you have to crawl before you walk. Once SF can have jurisdiction then they can ask for additional manpower. Also funds have to be adjusted to cover such costs, like gates and traffic lights. Just like anything new in the military, no one likes it at first, then it grows on them. This will not fix all matters as everyone still needs to stay vigilant and report said crimes and suspicious activities. All those who believe they have the best way to fix this, then ask for a housing meeting or city hall to discuss your concerns with leadership.

1280,324251608691_10153440971563692,"Sikorsky X2 on display outside AATD, building 401 Lee Blvd, Fort Eustis about March 2012. The aircraft maxed out at 259 mph. Fastest helicopter in the world today. The X2 is a coaxial helicopter.

A coaxial helicopter has two sets of counter-rotating vertical blades. The blades counter-rotate, as opposed to both rotating in the same direction, to counter each other?s angular momentum, which could make the aircraft unstable in flight. The counter-rotating blades eliminate the need for a stabilizing tail rotor. This configuration offers superior hovering power and stability.

A compound coaxial helicopter combines both features in an attempt to provide both a dependable stable platform for hovering as well as high forward speed. Since coaxial helicopters do not need a conventional tail rotor, it is replaced with one or more larger, more powerful, airplane-like propellers for forward propulsion. A rear-mounted ?pusher? propeller is usually used, though more standard propellers may be mounted on outrigger wings.

The concept is said to be scalable, meaning that larger and more robust versions of this configuration are possible. Besides the standard civilian and military versions, Sikorsky envisions big heavy-lift descendants of the X2, which will be able to lift payloads of up to 40 tons and still fly at speeds of 250 knots or better.",2015-11-18T21:31:12+0000,10153440971563692_10153441077558692,10152510907541189,2

For what it's worth, Stubby was never referred to as a pit bull in period publications about him. He's called a mixed breed and a Boston terrier mix. (He was quite small, in case that's not obvious from the photo.) 

At the time Stubby served, the United States didn't have a working dog program at all. The US didn't have war dogs until World War 2.

There is an established order to how areas are cleared, re-cleared and maintained. This order is based on mission priority. 

We encourage you to continue to post information about un-plowed roads and areas that require extra precautions. That kind of feedback is incredibly valuable to everyone on Langley and Fort Eustis. However, please understand that the removal teams on both installations are continuing to work throughout the day to remove the snow as quickly and efficiently as possible, while still practicing good operational safety.",2014-01-30T15:51:39+0000,10152019585728692_11935371,324251608691,0

Nothing against the plowers, they can only do so much with the tools they have, but I was fine driving until I got on base.  I almost wrecked twice trying to even pull into the parking lot at work and then I struggled in my little car to get into a parking spot.  Not sure I'll be able to get back out of the spot once my day is over.  I think it would have been better to keep the base closed one more day and let the snow melt a bit in the warmer temps.  All the other bases and schools stayed closed.  I feel like this was a bad decision",2014-01-30T19:05:28+0000,10152019585728692_11936670,10204473717356886,12

I live in the Foxhill/Buckroe community and was still in very bad shape. I got stuck in my neighborhood and have to have someone help me this morning, and saw a few accidents along the way. While I have no problem putting myself at risk and coming in to do my job, I do have a problem putting my 3 month old son in the car and taking him to daycare across Hampton to an FCC provider whose neighborhood was also in VERY bad condition. And due to the constant media coverage that most roads were clear, I assumed that was the case-but it just wasn't. And while I appreciate how much work the plowing contractors have done I too believe it was premature to call people back in today. I get that the flight line is priority 1, but people were told to come back to work and try and drive and park in areas covered in ice and snow. I think that when weighing it all the benefits did not outweigh the risk.",2014-01-30T17:32:31+0000,10152019585728692_11936086,10154328318994698,6

The plows can only do so much but the roads are driveable.  Parking lots are not as cleared but oh well...Once cars start traveling on base and around base what is left will break up.  The people that worked the last 2 days did a great job with the time and resources they were given.  I think everyone needs to stop and think about those that worked the last 2 days and focus on the positives....we're in Hampton Roads and it is some snow....not Afghanistan where things are worse....just my two cents.

Because of winter weather conditions, the City of Hampton declared a local state of emergency Wednesday, which will allow the city to track storm expenditures for possible reimbursement if a federal declaration is made.

More than 30 trucks worked through the night Tuesday to clear at least one lane on every major roadway in the city. So far, Road crews have dropped 300 tons of salt and 20,000 gallons of brine on city roads.

Wednesday evening, Hampton City Spokesperson Robin McCormick said most primary roads were relatively clear, like Kecoughtan, Pembroke, Settler?s Landing, Mercury, LaSalle, Old Buckroe and Nickerson. Most secondary and residential streets are not clear. McCormick said crews will continue to clear roads, working in teams to drop salt and then scrape up ice.

Since the beginning of the winter storm, the Hampton Police Division has responded to 155 storm related complaints and at least 181 disabled vehicles, six vehicle crashes, two with injuries. The Hampton Fire Department has handled 10 of those complaints.

The city still urges residents to stay off the roads, if at all possible.",2014-01-30T12:02:55+0000,10152018866458692_11933922,10152844635371276,9

The 25 BMI and 18% body fat standard adopted by the AF is the strictest permissible by DODI 1308.3.  Every other branch permits BMI of 25-27.5 and a body fat % that varies by age.  2.

4345,324251608691_10151775843653692,"There has been some confusion regarding the mention of genetic factors versus environmental ones as causes of the diseases. While genetics do factor in considerably, with as many as 1 in 5 people with Crohn's disease having a family member with the disease, environmental factors are a huge contributor as well. If you live in an urban area or in an industrialized country, you're more likely to develop Crohn's disease. Because Crohn's disease occurs more often among people living in cities and industrial nations, it may be that environmental factors, including a diet high in fat or refined foods, play a role in Crohn's disease. People living in northern climates also seem to have a greater risk of the disease. Sorry for the confusion in the story.

4772,324251608691_10151672638473692,"""is"" and ""are"" are both forms of the verb ""to be""

""is"" is singular, ""are"" is plural. 

For example, 
The kids are waiting for the movie to start. -- the subject is ""kids"" which is plural, so you use ""are""

vs.

The group of kids is waiting for the movie to start -- the subject is ""group"" which is singular (you can have more than one group) so you use ""is""

This is tricky because a group of kids is more than one person, but it's still a singular subject.

If you're still having trouble, try re-writing the sentence without the modifiers to isolate the subject.

In our examples, this would be...

The kids ARE waiting 
vs 
The group IS waiting

5320,324251608691_10151541164383692,"Check out these safety tips for before and during a tornado, courtesy of ready.gov:

Before:
- Build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.
- Be alert to changing weather conditions. Look for approaching storms.
- Look for the following danger signs:
- Dark, often greenish sky
- Large hail
- A large, dark, low-lying cloud (particularly if rotating)
- Loud roar, similar to a freight train.
- If you see approaching storms or any of the danger signs, be prepared to take shelter immediately...

During:
- If you are under a tornado warning, seek shelter immediately! Most injuries associated with high winds are from flying debris, so remember to protect your head.
- If you are in a structure, go to a pre-designated shelter area such as a safe room, basement, storm cellar, or the lowest building level. If there is no basement, go to the center of an interior room on the lowest level (closet, interior hallway) away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls.
- If you are in a trailer or mobile home, get out immediately and go to the lowest floor of a sturdy, nearby building or a storm shelter.
- If you are in the outside with no shelter, immediately get into a vehicle, buckle your seat belt and try to drive to the closest sturdy shelter. Do not get under an overpass or bridge. You are safer in a low, flat location. Watch out for flying debris. Flying debris from tornadoes causes most fatalities and injuries.",2013-06-10T23:29:15+0000,10151541164383692_9851202,324251608691,0

Then multiple TDYs, some last more than a month throughout much of the next decade. In the last 6 years, the kids have watched their Dad deploy 3 times in 3 years from Langley AFB, be geographically separated for 2 more years and have him home just on the weekends, missing many school and life events. Now, he's gone for a year overseas--as his son starts high school, Kate goes to prom and Ellie graduates elementary school--he'll miss it all. All 3 kids, Kaitlyn, Drew and Elizabeth, have done so much better than I could have. Poor Ellie doesn't even remember a time when her father has just been home--he started the cycle of deployments when she was just 3 and now she's almost 11. They're not perfect and it's sometimes pretty rocky, but they bear up so well and really try to pitch in and help out. Kate has been taking her siblings to some of their activities, freeing me up; Drew has taken charge of all the electronics in the house and being Mr Fix It; and Ellie has taken to organizing everything in the house! I'm just so very proud of them and a bit in awe at how they've handled the last 8 years.",2013-04-09T15:45:37+0000,10151441120488692_9361230,10203485921181746,3

However if the base is put on a 2 hour delay like Eustis then the hospital will not open clinics until after the two hour delay and all appt missed because they were earlier would need to be reschedule.

At the eleventh hour, of the eleventh day, of the eleventh month, ninety-four years ago the ""Guns of August"" finally fell silent for the first time in over four years. As their sound faded off into history the ""The Great War"" did as well taking with it more than 16 million servicemembers and civilians from all sides.

It was only last year that the world lost its last Veteran of World War One. It's now up to us to keep the heritage, the legacy, and the lessons that he and his compatriots who went ""Over There"" left for us.

Amongst those that never returned home was Lieutenant Colonel John Alexander McCrae, MD, (November 30, 1872 ? January 28, 1918) a physician in the Canadian Army. Soon after burying his friend and former medical student, Lt. Alexis Helmer, on the Western Front in 1915, McCrae put pen to paper and wrote the immortal poem that he will always be remembered for:

In Flanders Fields

In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.",2012-11-11T16:13:54+0000,10151176123153692_8269187,10203717387919828,4

wetland habitats in it occurs by rapidly out-competing native vegetation. Consequently, if allowed to go unchecked the biodiversity greatly decreases creating unhealthy, monoculture habitats. Few native wildlife can tolerate these conditions. Additionally, because of its growth rate and thickness this also increases the risks of wildland fires and creates other safety issues. Controlling this plant economically and effectively is accomplished via using specific herbicide formulations, and in this case is the herbicide
Polaris. It is disseminated in accordance with its label by certified
applicators as required by federal and state regulations. The areas
treated are not areas the general installation would be entering.",2011-10-05T21:10:11+0000,10150323512158692_19037271,324251608691,0

Sure let's get rid of the oil using a chemical when in fact the chemical did more harm than help. Seriously. I would not believe any ""label"" before I took it and tested it myself. Go dig up a few plants, native and invasive. See which one it kills then test it by putting it into a fish tank with gosh and crabs and oysters and test them to see if there is any chemicals in them, then do the same to the local wildlife species. Then if all that shows that it really only kills he ""bad"" plants and nothing shows up anywhere else then maybe consider it. I'm not trying to be a troublemaker although I know that is what it sounds like, and it is good you told people about it, but it seems like the govt in general takes the environment for granted. If it doesnt harm humans or animals would you take your child or dog out while it happens? And don't tell me it isn't where people usually go.

Of course they might not work if you have a Houdini child, able to get out of everything. My condolences to the family.",2011-09-09T17:54:53+0000,10150290342488692_18575286,10203072368752231,1

I don't care if her mother had 2 broken legs your children do not just ""wander off"" autistic or not. I have 4 GOD children aging in ranges from 6 to 2 that I baby sit often for their parents. At no point have either of them ever ever ever ever wandered off and I've used the bathroom, cooked, went to my car and done a ton of other things where my attention was not ""completely"" on them. I am very sympathic over this unfortunate situation.  I mourn over the fact that she's gone but than GOD he took her to a better place than where she was at. At the same time, you have to be responsible for your children. She had ONE child, seriously? Now you're trying to convince me that ""oh kids just wander that's what they do"". Okay.

I opted to go to warwick high school instead of going on post. My area had a MANDATORY evacuation on friday, yet Eustis (which is less than 5 mins. away from my house) did not open its EEC until 9 the next morning!only to close it's gates an hour later. HORRIBLE. Thankfully the hurricane did not do much damage but I still think of the what ifs. My husband is currently in Korea and I felt absolutley no support. Not even a text. I had to search for answers myself and luckily I ran into this page where I was able to get some info. If family was truly first, we would've had more concrete answers and orientation in other places other than a facebook page!!!! I'm glad I accidentally ran into this page because it was the only source of info I had as far as what was going on in Ft. Eustis.

I have never ""name called"" or attacked any individual.  

My sources have asked to remain nameless so they won't be subject to unfair criticism for having suggestions and concerns about management of the incident.

My apologies for spelling Col Kirkland's name wrong.  

The words ""An investigation into the incident and a review of the incident operations are underway."" would appear to indicate that an investigation was at that time underway.  I think it will continue for a bit.  It should not simply be an after action report, but should go to levels of detail beyond that -  especially addressing whether combining security forces between two installations of different services was a good idea. 

I don't know why the comment was removed.  It is a fact that it was.  

Again, you appear to have inside information.  Instead of attacking those who identify legitimate concerns, move on, fix what you can.

7404,324251608691_112659208763565,Yes as Transportation Wives our spouses can go and have gone everywhere. The point of being on base is to be safe and as comfortable as possible. I believe all Christy was doing was expressing an opinion of how that is not happening as Fort Eustis is filled with Construction now and the roads are not ideal. We all as military spouses should respect each other and Patti please do not attach other wives as you do not know what they have gone or are going through.
