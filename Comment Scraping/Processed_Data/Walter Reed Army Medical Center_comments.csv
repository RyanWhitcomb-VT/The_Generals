Ever year a post on facebook goes Viral with wrong information about sending ""Recovering Soldiers"" Christmas cards with Walter Reeds old D.C address. Walter Reed shut down in D.C in 2011 and opened up in Bethesda Maryland. But As far as sending direct mail to Walter Reed you can't because a policy (Transportation Policy) was made by the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense in 2001. To protect soldiers and medical staff. You can go through local Red Cross office, Military Treatment Facility or VA Hospital to obtain the local guidelines for sending cards. They all go through the cards to make sure they are safe to be delivered. But the deadline for the Red Cross has passed so you take your cards to your Local VA Hospital. https://www.facebook.com/Walter-Reed-National-Military-Medical-Center-295857217111107/?fref=ts&hc_location=ufi",2015-12-18T21:07:10+0000,10153481003453533_10153481042983533,1131504596876132,5

If you are referring to the media coverage of the poor conditions a few years ago, please keep in mind that it was NEVER the hospital that was in disrepair, but the privately owned housing units in which the soldiers were living while getting outpatient treatment.  I have been inside Walter Reed several times a week for the past three years, and can assure you that it was NOT in disrepair, no walls were falling down, and the care they receive there has never wavered.   It is very sad to see this wonderful historic landmark being closed, but please don't sully the reputation of this fine institution based on media misrepresentation.",2011-07-27T23:21:17+0000,10150256197623533_17830867,10202905903705345,3

In the early 70's when I was stationed there that particular ward which is actually across the street from the Georgia Ave. Main entrance was actually a motor Hotel called the Walter Reed Inn. My Parents stayed there when they came to visit me in July of 1970. I hope this clears up any questions.,2011-07-27T23:29:54+0000,10150256197623533_17830978,10202266821945883,2

I've never been to any of the off base places but the way they treated, or allowed others to treat or failed to repair those lovely old buildings is just a shame!  The old hospital used to have a lovely suite that President Eisenhower lived in and it was a shambles, it should have been turned into a landmark and repaired.  I've been behind the scenes, I lived there, I know what it was like in the 80's and I seriously doubt the Army improved it any, it's not their style, I've been on too many Army bases to believe that.  I'm really mad they are closing it.  I love WRAMC, I love it dearly, I'm angry they didn't take care of it and preserve it.",2011-07-28T00:01:46+0000,10150256197623533_17831284,10202835792628160,0

All those plane trips for Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Obiden going places that are really not necessary but they have to look like they are doing something.The dining and wining at the white house allot of that could be cut out.

However, you are not in a position to judge these young Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Guardsmen and Marines.

I hate to get overly descriptive here, but try to imagine for a moment what it's like to see your best friend that you've shared 3 meals a day with, prayed with, experienced happiness, joy and fear for your life with, all in the same day... then to see that best friend killed before your eyes, in a very gruesome way, and in many cases, witness things that a seasoned coroner isn't prepared to handle.  And to do it at 18, 19, or 20 years old.  To have to then go back to the barracks, clean your friend off of you, and then go back out on a patrol the next day.

If you understood the horrors of war, you would not say such a hurtful thing.  These young men and women are trying to come to grips with the most traumatic and difficult things that a person can experience.

I got involved in literally taking care of a dying friend and was so immersed in her care I forgot myself and watching her changed my perspective on death and dying and living.  You've got to get involved in something outside of yourself.  When I was most suicidal was when I was concentrating solely on myself.  When I started concentrating on others, the people I love and care for, life took on new meaning and I realized my own value and how loved I truly was and how many people would be hurt if I died.

My son wasn't at Walter Reed but has visited wounded buddies there. He is now a veteran (since this past December).

899,94176393532_122689541113537," I very much appreciate all of you taking the time to share your thoughts about Walter Reed on our Facebook page, and I offer these comments in reply.

We cannot discuss any individual patient's health care in a public forum; however, I can give you these assurances about care for wounded warriors at Walter Reed:

We listen to all of our patients, and each patient has multiple channels available for questions about their care. If answers given by the doctors and nurses providing care are not satisfactory, we have a patient advocacy office and an inspector general available to all patients. Military patients have ombudsmen available to them for help on any issue.  

If the other support channels are not meeting our patients or their families? needs, my door is always open. If there are issues, we want to know about them so we can make it right and prevent them from occurring in the future.

Military patients assigned or attached to the Warrior Transition Brigade have a squad leader assigned to provide all kinds of support during sometimes lengthy periods of healing and rehabilitation.  These wounded, ill or injured warriors also have a nurse case manager assigned to coordinate all the various types of specialty medical care they may need, and a primary care manager - a physician assigned to them for all primary care needs. Each warrior has a care plan tailored to his or her individual medical needs.

Family members play an important role in the healing process. Family members initially arriving to meet a recently injured patient are supported by our Soldier Family Assistance Center with many types of help. Many family members become Non-Medical Attendants and reside with their wounded warrior at Walter Reed during recovery.

The whole purpose of the Warrior Transition Brigade is to help wounded, ill and injured warriors heal.  The brigade leadership, the social workers, physical and occupational therapists, chaplains, nurses and doctors are here to help them move forward in their transition back to duty or back to civilian life. -- Col. Van Coots, commander, Walter Reed Health Care System

See a neurologist, get an EEG, talk to family doctor, as is medical professionals are in denial that service vets, and for that matter survivors of traumatic violence will be diagnosed with PTSD unless you pop the pills that they try to insist you take. Then...  More they prescribe ... and then they prescibe more pills.

And the media wonders why there are so many deaths caused by presciption, over the counter medications. Medical professionals only want to keep prescribing pills to keep those companies flowing with FDA or non FDA authorised meds.

Just as long as the fat asses(I like cats)in the drug companies have more money in their pockets...

That is all that matters to them.

No one in the medical field want to talk about PTSD or Anxiety, or help to communicate about how to survive without popping pills. Too much trouble. Too much work. Less money to the fat asses!

However a key component of battlefield care is to triage and sort out most injured, dying, seriously wounded, etc. Obviously it would be irresponsible to treat minor injuries ahead of very serious casualties. (Not to mean your injuries were minor. From your tone, they sounded serious as well.)

I agree this training should have been done quite some time ago. Its delay of implementation has caused probably needless death and certainly a lot of other complications with much more suffering.

Also I agree the Iraqi's need to step up and take care of their own security. The sooner the better IMO....Also the sooner we can downsize our troop strength in this Theater.

However, I think anyone helping the US military and that is fighting with us should be definitely extended medical care, be they Allies (NATO) or Iraqi military, police, interpreters, etc.",2010-07-13T08:27:17+0000,128805120495117_811977,10202370288562119,0

1412,94176393532_106460732725401,"Soldiers and others in the military are trained, and trained, and trained...  To me the value of the training can be evaluated only by the level of true communication achieved, and whether that communication moves the individual to develop their own personal plan to meet the challenge.  First you have to overcome the amount of training they must endure having the effect of becoming so much, ""blah, blah, blah,"" and capture their attention.  I think this might be a way in which that can be done.  No one can really be prepared for the realities of war to the point that they are not profoundly impacted.  Having served as a nurse many years, I know something of all the stressors mentioned in this article.  When I use to coach little girls in girls softball I used the approach of asking them, what are you going to do when the ball comes to you?  I would tell them you must know that the ball is coming to you, and already know what you are going to do with it when it comes to you.  I think this type of training helps to focus the Soldier toward this thinking.  The only thing I would do would be to force the Soldier, through different role play etc, to write or state what resources they would utilize to face and overcome these stressors.  It is in having a plan, and a plan B, and a plan C, that ""successful"" deployment is achieved, especially in this area of stress.",2010-04-06T15:12:34+0000,106460732725401_151680,862968703715978,0

Thought i would try some different things this year.  i took an ornament from the tree at Giant Eagle for local nursing home residents and when I saw the call for cards i thought that sounds good so I called upon Holden and some of his friends to start it off.  They loved the idea. Then I put the box of cards in the waiting room and our patients were a big help.  Then the snag but I'll persue it.  Like you say Christmas in July works too!  Thanks for responding.,2014-12-19T00:34:44+0000,180503705619_10153477429045620,619510888125123,0

It lists the address for Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Georgia Ave, which closed more than 4 years ago. PLEASE, if and when you see this FaceBook Post, respond to correct it. Any cards sent to 5900 Georgia Ave, ""Any Service Member,"" or to ""A Recovering American Service Member"" will be returned to sender because the address does not exist.
