386,86506442610_10153168791902611,"STOLEN MILITARY BENEFIT ? Since WW II, Americans who are currently serving and their dependents have been eligible to utilize the Armed Forces Recreation Centers located in Germany. Since 1989, retirees and 100% disabled veterans and their dependents have been eligible to use these facilities. Today, only one is in operation, Edelweiss Lodge and Resort, located in Garmisch, Germany. In June 2015, a EUCOM (formally USAREUR) JAG reinterpreted the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and decided that all currently serving active and reserve component military personnel, all military retirees, all 100% disabled veterans and dependents, not assigned to or residing in EUCOM/Germany are no longer entitled to use Edelweiss, despite an official policy letter in 1989 that authorizes their use of the AFRC in Europe. The EUCOM CG accepted this reinterpretation/opinion. So, for over 25 years there has been no problem but on one opinion, our benefit vanished.  But now,  German military members, NATO military members, U.S. diplomatic officials and U.S. civilians employed by the U.S. government in EUCOM are entitled to use our facility. What an insult. A majority of U.S. military I.D. card holders are excluded while service personnel from other countries and our politicians can use our facility. Our earned benefit was stolen through an administrative decision, without the knowledge of our elected officials or considering the negative impact this has on so very many people. It does not matter whether you have ever used the AFRC in Germany or whether you will ever use it. This is simply yet another lost/stolen benefit. Since June 2015, congressmen/women and senators have been receiving letters of complaint over this loss, however, we are just now starting to see some movement in restoring our benefit. This action can easily be corrected with a change to AER 600-700 by the same EUCOM CG who denies us the use of Edelweiss. The German government did not cause this debacle, nor did the U.S. State Department.
     I am requesting that all readers of this information immediately write to your elected officials and ask them what they are personally doing to have this earned benefit returned. Some elected officials have responded in a positive manner while other have simply quoted the Edelweiss L&R eligibility criteria, which we already know. If you have not seen the new eligibility criteria, go to www.edelweisslodgeandresort.com and scroll down to ?eligibility criteria.? Be prepared for the insult.  Help us save this benefit. We are in a very critical period which will decide the fate of this benefit but we must maintain pressure on Washington.
   In this first quarter of 2016, we need many new letters of protest hitting Washington. Please complain to your congressmen/women and senators. If we let this benefit fade away quietly, what is next?",2016-02-10T21:43:26+0000,10153168791902611_10153280292382611,1216729875023089,0

399,86506442610_10153125990867611,"Joshua, Jesus, God, Elijah, free speech, Obama, Islam, Oprah, the Pope, the 2nd amendment, and the golden rule

No matter what you think of the Bible or religion, everyone on earth needs to know this as much as they need the air they breathe

In Deuteronomy 18 Moses said that God would provide Israel with a prophet like himself and that they were to listen to and obey whatever he said. That prophet was a close friend of Moses named Joshua and he was ?filled with the spirit of God.? Jesus identified with the God (love) that ?spoke? to Moses and Joshua and Elijah and all the other prophets so completely that he could speak of himself as that God. Therefore, Jesus would say that when Moses and Joshua and Elijah said that ?the Lord? said something it was just as if they were speaking of Jesus saying it. All of these people warned people about the dangers posed by those who did not live by the golden rule and they ridiculed, mocked, made fun of them for their ridiculous ideas (1st Kings 18), met them in ferocious bloody battles, and executed their false prophets all with the approval and help from God or Jesus in other words.

Jesus? mission, he said, was to bring good news (gospel) to Israel that they could run the Romans out and ?restore? control of the kingdom to Israel if they?d trust him and what he was teaching which was the golden rule that would unite them in love for each other instead of them being divided into numerous arguing sects. If they didn?t listen to him, however, they?d die in their sins or as slaves to Rome in other words. In other words, Jesus said, ?I didn?t come to tell you to compromise and make peace with Rome. I came instead to raise an army (church) and start a war with Rome in the near future and teach you how to make peace with God at the same time. 

So, when Joshua, in Joshua 24, said that Israel needed to choose that very day who they would serve but as for himself and his family they would serve ?the Lord? it was precisely the same as saying that he was going to obey Jesus. This was the same Joshua that ?the Lord? had told to annihilate all the people in the land of Canaan that did not practice the golden rule but worshiped Baal instead that required human sacrifices and all kinds of other terrible things. In fact, in 24:20 Joshua warned the people that if they abandoned ?the Lord? or the golden rule in other words, God (Jesus) would make terrible things happen to them like foreign nations enslaving them as Assyria, Babylon, Greece, and Rome did later on once they?d thoroughly abandoned the practice of the golden rule enough. 

Now, Islam with its Sharia law that?s totally opposite to the golden rule and enforces so many of the same kinds of atrocities done by those who worshiped Baal, is taking control of the entire world for the same reason Israel was enslaved. The 2nd amendment is based on the golden rule and every Christian is commanded by Jesus via the golden rule and that 2nd amendment to defend themselves, their families, and America with lethal force from that enemy who is being aided and abetted by people in high places filled with demonic spirits. It was true in the days of Joshua and it?s just as true today. The Pope is wrong! ?No one,? said Jesus, ?can legitimately claim to be my disciple and be saved and not do what I say.? 

Oprah has believed the centuries old lie, a lie that?s promoted by Muslims using taqiyya, that ?spiritual warfare? is just an inner struggle with one?s conscience to be a good person and that Islam has nothing to do with terrorism when, in reality, it?s fundamentally based on terror. Simply by reading the oldest and most authoritative Muslim materials and the Bible it?s easy to see that nothing could be further from the truth. Obama says that Islam should be judged by what it is rather than what it isn?t. Well, Islam can?t possibly be a religion of peace and tolerance because it has everything to do with terrorism.

The golden rule has been twisted by false teachers to mean that rapists, pedophiles, thieves, slavers, and murderers are to receive your sympathy rather than those you love and who have the natural right to expect you to care for them just as you?d want them to care for you. And, the second amendment has been twisted to mean that armed and well regulated militias are the right of the government instead of that God given or natural right, as the amendment plainly says, belonging to ?the people? apart from government control for the very purpose of staying free from being enslaved by tyrants wanting to enslave you.

So, choose today. Will you be enslaved or murdered along with everyone you love? My family and I are armed and we?re going to try to stay free and serve the Lord. See Acts 4:19

877,86506442610_10152331662582611,"I must tell Parson's story. I noticed him in the Commissary parking lot a few weeks ago. The constuction workers told me that him and his friend Cory, another kitten, hung out/lived there. Being a huge animal lover and a volunteer at the Stray Facility on post, I wanted to give them a better life. So I set traps and within an hour I had them both.

The Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has sent out notification that the release of furlough notices to our civilian employees will be delayed for approximately two weeks.  Important to note that this is a temporary delay and not a cancellation of the furlough, while DOD sorts through the fiscal implications of a continuing resolution.  This means that you should not expect a furlough notice to arrive until approximately April 5th. This would mean that furlough dates will also be pushed to begin no sooner than early May. This could have an impact on the overall number of furlough days, but currently there is no indication of any decision this will lessen the number of required furlough days from the planned 22 days.

I would ask you all to remain flexible in the coming days as this delay will cause us to readjust our own timelines for such things as the Furlough Supervisory Training Session, and the next post-wide Town Hall meeting.  We will do our best to ensure that you have the latest information as it becomes available.  Thank you for your patience and all that you do to take care of our force and our families.

2585,86506442610_10150279407417611,Lyons - It's not the fact that we can't get out the gate it's the fact that there is no arterial road from the west side to the main gate.  We have to travel through housing; there is no alternative.  Have you ever tried to get from the west side of post to the main gate when the kids are out of school?  It's a safety nightmare.,2011-08-25T19:15:58+0000,10150279407417611_4930862,10202466601175237,3
2586,86506442610_10150279407417611,"It doesn't bother me that they are limiting the gate hours. However, I would say keep it open for in and outbound until 6:30. If they would've kept the commercial/visitor traffic coming through Hancock it would meet their little quota. Having it closed on the weekends/holidays isn't really a huge deal either. I would be upset if I lived on Kansas though. That is already a tight area with houses on top of each other and a TON of kids. I have already had to stop suddenly MANY times for kids darting in and out of traffic. How long until a child gets hit by a car until post realizes $300,000 isn't too much money compared to the life of a child?! Also did they think that maybe they could shift a guard or 2 over from Grant after their peak hours, say from 1530 on. Traffic there diminishes greatly after people get back from lunch and high school students are done with school. There is no reason for all the extra guards standing around at Grant or having 4 lanes open after 1530. Sounds like someone did this as a quick and easy fix. Also, they could pull a MP or 2 off the road or from sleeping in cars to cover the gates. I have been at many larger posts and never seen such an MP presence on the roads as I do here and this is a TINY post. This really seems like a knee jerk reaction!!",2011-08-25T19:46:17+0000,10150279407417611_4931019,10203058306599964,2

Well great now we can dodge their cars while they sit on the side of the road waiting to sink their chompers into one of us for some dumb crap when people are haulling butt over at Grant.
