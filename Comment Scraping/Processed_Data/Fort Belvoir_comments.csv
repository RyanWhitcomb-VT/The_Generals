I know it's a little late, but here is my Dad, a charter member of the 30th Engineer Bn (Topo) here on FT Belvoir ca. 1941-1942.  He served a total of 20 years (Jan 1940 - Jan 1960) retiring as a CW3.  He then undertook another 20 years of Civil Service working for Army Map Service, which became Defense Mapping Agency (now NGA) where he worked on the Lunar Orbiter mapping of the moon for the Apollo missions and the Mariner mapping of Mars.

Can someone please explain this rationale? I am not being snippy, but every time they talk about the impending traffic disaster we all know this will be, no one actually answers the question regarding the obvious solution of temporarily opening other gates. 

For instance, opening Walker and Beulah would be helpful. Obviously the personnel who would have been working at the closed gate can work there. And I routinely see surplus guards standing around at gates, so I am not overly concerned about the taxing physical toll of spreading these folks around a bit. 

Seriously, this is most likely going to have a huge disruption of day to day operations. There have to be better solutions and explanations than what we are getting here.",2016-09-16T12:30:26+0000,1257217230976136_1257801207584405,601433042720,4

We're still losing too many soldiers daily and the Army chain of command still makes behavioral health taboo or punishable. We all gasp at the idea of ""punishment"" for those who need help, but I've seen people get an article 15 for attempted suicide, rank reduction boards, and overall loss of support where it destroys an NCOs career and home life. Now, the Army is losing good soldiers because they can't balance their health, career, and family. A broken life is a good title for this article.

Many agree that this is a disservice to the residents and should be corrected immediately! We understand that there is an increased cost associated with improved security, but exactly what price can be applied to the safety and security of our servicemembers, their families, and their belongings? Are they not important enough? Would this issue be fixed if higher ranking personnel were assigned military housing off-post? We also understand that living in military housing is an option, and a privilege, but many of our junior enlisted servicemembers have limited options in this high cost of living area - and have elected to live in military housing for safety, security, and community.

Move immediately to higher ground. 
Do not wait for instructions to move.
Always stay away from floodwaters. 
? Even six inches of swiftly moving water can knock someone off their feet. 
? Be aware of streams, drainage channels and other areas known to flood suddenly. 
? Keep your children inside and away from streams and creeks.  Stay away from downed power lines to avoid the risk of electric shock or electrocution 
Do not drive on flooded roads ? ""turn around, don?t drown."" 
? The depth, current and condition of the road are all unknowns and can be deadly. 
? If your vehicle stalls on a flooded road and water is rising, get out of the car, call 9-1-1 and move to higher ground. 
? Approximately two feet of swift water can move or float most vehicles, including SUV?s and pickup trucks. 
? Be especially cautious during periods of limited visibility or nighttime when it is extremely difficult to see and judge conditions -- state law requires headlights when wipers are on.",2016-02-03T19:29:36+0000,1098182900212904_1098183683546159,110389852325552,0

2987,110389852325552_1024967584201103,"This is a great video ""IF""  the belvoir circle was actually shaped like this.  The problem is that  there are 2 exits from the circle (the hospital side and the community center side) that are single lane exits.  Therefore, even if the driver in the inside lane and the driver in the right lane on Belvoir road were both wanting to exit to the community center or on the other side to the hospital there is only one lane that they both must enter.  Yes, the Belvoir road drivers should all YIELD to the driver in the circle - but being that the drivers here in the US have no idea that they are supposed to 'signal' (yes, that little blinker thing on the car) when you are exiting the circle, the Belvoir road driver has no clue if the inner circle driver is exiting or continuing on... so at times they take their chances.  This circle either needs to be single lane OR be redesigned in such a way as to force drivers to use it properly.  

In addition it would be massively helpful if the lines were kept painted. They are faded in such a way that cars drift from one lane to the other and back again as they go around the circle.",2015-09-01T12:55:53+0000,1024967584201103_1024970357534159,774938382582787,29

2989,110389852325552_1024967584201103,"Ironically, I have followed several MP's around the traffic circle. Half of them exit to the hospital from the inside lane and the other half from the outside lane. So, when there isn't even consistency with the MP's, how can we possibly expect consistency with regular drivers? I agree the lines need to be repainted (and kept up) to better facilitate drivers who are unfamiliar with traffic circles. I also agree this video does not address the hospital exit or community center exit as they are exits where only one lane can exit, not both as addressed in the video. Another suggestion would be to include better signage at the traffic circle which would further aid drivers. I have driven around many traffic circles, and this is the most poorly designed, poorly painted, and poorly signed one I've seen.",2015-09-01T13:18:41+0000,1024967584201103_1024976827533512,10205845618286090,8
2990,110389852325552_1024967584201103,"The big problem is that because so many people ride the outside lane all the way around, many times you cannot get to the inside lane to properly utilize this circle.  At high volume times those of us who would love to properly use it cannot due to so many who do not understand the workings of traffic circles.  The fault is not really in the drivers but in the traffic engineers who think it is a great idea to place circles in areas where drivers are not trained for circles.  Single lane circles can work fine in low congestion areas like neighborhoods - they slow the rate of speed without bumps and reduce the number of unnecessary stop signs.  But highly traveled areas with multi-lane circles AND without forced traffic flow devices is simply a recipe for disaster.",2015-09-01T13:31:37+0000,1024967584201103_1024980537533141,774938382582787,6

Pushing little kids down so we left for the pool instead. Housing it was a wonderful idea but parents are at fault for you having to cancel. If you don't look after your children folks I am sure a foster family would! Heidi A Ashcraft is right I have seen too many itty bitty children out without parents in sight. Bad stuff can happen on a base just like out in town don't get comfortable! I think some things need to change on this base helmets need to be worn (bikes, scooters or skateboards) a base we just came from gave the parents tickets if the child was found without one. I think that there should be an age limit on how old they need to be to play outside ALONE!

By doing so they take away an activity that many enjoyed due to the ones that weren't able to follow the rules. Instead they should have a sign in sheet. No child allowed without a parent.

 Take frequent rest breaks when working in hot conditions. These breaks can consist of moving to a cooler area or switching to lighter work for awhile.
 Drink plenty of water and drink it often. Beverages such as coffee, cola and beer don't replenish the water in your system; they actually deplete it. Keep an emergency supply of water on hand for this and other emergencies.
 Take it easy on yourself. Avoid strenuous activities in the heat of the day, especially if you are not accustomed to them. Schedule heavy work and fitness workouts for the cooler hours.
 Take it easy on the power grid, too. Avoid unnecessary use of electricity while air conditioners are running. A power failure during a heat wave can result in more deaths.
 Hot weather is especially hard on the young, the old and those in ill health. Keep young children as
cool and comfortable as you can.
Dress lightly, in layers so that you can subtract or add clothing as the temperature
changes. Be sure to shade the skin against the sun. Remind your workers frequently to
protect themselves from sunburn by covering up with lightweight clothing and using
sunscreen.
Watch each other for signs of heat illness. Mild cases can be treated by moving the
person to a cool area and supplying water to drink. Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition
which calls for immediate medical help.",2015-06-23T15:58:28+0000,988233614541167_988361177861744,110389852325552,0

which have been used while working. These cramps may occur after work, when the person is resting.
Heat cramps are a signal that the body has lost too much salt through sweating.
 Heat Exhaustion. Heat exhaustion is a serious condition that needs immediate attention. It may
have any or all of these symptoms: A feeling of exhaustion, nausea, dizziness, pale and clammy skin,
quick pulse, and low blood pressure. Heat exhaustion is also a warning that the mechanism which controls heat for the body has become seriously overtaxed. Heat stroke may follow if heat exhaustion is not treated.
 Heat Stroke. Heat stroke is a serious matter and it can be fatal. It occurs when the body's heat control mechanism simply shuts down. Perspiration stops and the body temperature rises. The heart pounds and the skin becomes flushed and hot. This condition is a medical emergency and must be treated immediately.",2015-06-23T15:54:36+0000,988233614541167_988359264528602,110389852325552,0

The view is lovely, but it's a very small pool.  Their web site, which hasn't been updated since 2012 boasts ""check cashing services"" as a benefit.

Belvoir continues to recruit and hire Dept. of the Army Security Guards to operate access control points on post. Despite these efforts, the Directorate of Emergency Services has yet to reach the total number of authorized guards due to attrition. As a result, guards have been working mandatory overtime.

Dear civilians, 

Please pardon an old Army veteran for intruding upon the first day of your summer vacation season:

I happened upon Private Gilmer W. White's grave over four years ago while looking around the small cemetery of my great-grandmother's small church in rural Stokes County.  Having served my first assignment with the 3rd Infantry Division (Marne Division) in Cold War Germany, during which I shared a kaserne with the 1st Battalion of the 7th Infantry Regiment (Cottonbalers), upon reading ""7 INF 3 INF DIV,"" I exclaimed, ""Cottonbaler! Rock of the Marne!""  When I read the date of death, I instinctively snapped to attention and rendered a hand salute.  I knew that the 3rd ID had been fighting its way through southern France from the late summer of 1944 through the early winter of 1945, so I realized that Private White had been killed in action.  All I know of him is what is on his marker, but I suppose he was just a Stokes County farm boy . . . 

Freedom isn't free . . .

Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,
But he'll remember, with advantages,
What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,
Familiar in his mouth as household words?
. . .
From this day to the ending of the world
But we in it shall be remember?d,
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.
For he today that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother...

Rock of the Marne!
This We'll Defend!

A dog-walking 'station' was promised almost 2 years ago and still none exist. How hard can installing one of 2 of them really be? We'd have garbage removal, just paying a refuse company directly if we didn't have a HOA. For me, I am not getting my money's worth out of HOA fees. Just do not see a benefit. But - good for you - really!

The Commission, led by the energetic Teddy Roosevelt, laid the foundations of an impartial, professional civil service based on the merit principle ? that employees should be judged only on how well they can do the job.

In 1978, the Civil Service Commission was reorganized into three new organizations: the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority.  Each of these new organizations took over a portion of the Civil Service Commission?s responsibilities, with OPM responsible for personnel management of the civil service of the Government.""

That is an extremely loaded question, but here's the short of it:  Some of you may recall the museum that was on Ft. Myer and housed some awesome relics (now stored on Belvoir) and great history of it and The Old Guard (as well as other portions of the Army if I'm not mistaken).  It was closed a few (5+?) years ago due to space issues.  Plans were drawn up to redo and add space (an additional floor, I think) to Ft. Myer's Town Hall (former theatre) to house the museum, but the economy tanked and funds weren't available.  So, if you happen to have a load of cash laying around and/or the time to devote to heading up a fundraising effort, contact the folks over at Ft.

7750,110389852325552_692490640789502,"To reiterate, the change to gate hours at Telegraph is the result of adjusting hours to the number of authorized Dept. of the Army Security Guards we are allowed to employ. This is complicated by the fact that recruiting and retaining guards is a constant challenge. Further, gate statistics are tracked and analyzed. Usage of Telegraph before 6 a.m. and after 6 p.m. indicates this adjustment impacts the smallest number of commuters. We realize that for those affected by the change find it inconvenient. Previously when Walker Gate hours were trimmed, there were similar issues. We don't receive funding to allow us to keep every gate open for the duration we know our community desires. This change mitigates the impact to the greatest extent possible when compared to other possible scenarios.",2014-02-06T17:01:59+0000,692490640789502_77340723,110389852325552,0

So, too, are the numbers of guards and dollars available, as well as the other requirements that must be fulfilled at the gates. I think we need to keep in mind that ...

* Neither Kingman nor Telegraph is set up for anything other than passenger vehicles. (The ADFE facility has its own gate directly off Telegraph.)

* Tulley is the Visitor gate, and, the only gate configured for security processing of delivery trucks. (Consider those drivers pulling huge daily loads to the PX and Commissary who have to go through Tulley to get to destinations that are just inside Kingman.)

* Pence is primary gate for the hospital, and, Walker is a key school bus gate serving the South Post neighborhoods.

It's an understandable and reasonable enough question to ask, ""Why not that way instead of this way?"" But, that VERY question was part of the decision-making process in the first place. How best to deploy the number of available guards without closing a gate COMPLETELY was and is the #1 consideration. That said, it's also reasonable to expect more adjustments later as Mulligan Road opens and Telegraph is widened, and, once the new gate into North Post off Route 1 (opposite Pence) opens next year.",2014-02-06T17:41:35+0000,692490640789502_77340810,10205956235533393,3

I understand budget cuts/ limited resources, but bottom line 0600 to 1800 does not support personnel who work at the Pentagon and take the Metro.  I believe most of us could make it to the gate after 0530 and get back by 1830; however 0600 to 1800 would cause most of us to miss one or both those times, thereby making an already tough commute that much harder.

One issue, of course, is juggling all the different calendars of the officials who have to be there, and finding a date that matches. But, the Exchange people tell us there's a more important reason. Many years of lessons learned have taught them that there is no such thing as a ""best"" time. But, they do it like this to have a couple days with customers to shake out the bugs before the really BIG rush of customers comes in on the first weekend. Sure enough, today, there was a glitch with cash register software that was to have downloaded from AAFES over night that didn't download. Result? A brief pause at all registers this morning until the problem got fixed.

That isn't a long commute in miles but it takes me about 45 minutes on average in bumper to bumper traffic to arrive at Tulley Gate, and about an hour on average to drive home in the afternoon. People drive horribly, trying to get one or two cars ahead, and the congestion just wears you down. I can't even say there is one specific part of my commute that I dislike. It is the same driving condition every bit of the way. And there isn't a faster route because everyone else is trying to find a faster route. And I almost never see any carpooling happening. One person per car, the same cars everyday...It hurts. An Omni bus route from Lake Ridge to Pence Gate would work wonders, IMO.

9818,110389852325552_534678346563365,"Kurt, it's a question of available staffing and usage rates at all gates on the weekends. As you know, Walker Gate during the week is an especially busy gate for traffic entering post not just for River, GW and Dogue Creek, but the other neighborhoods on South Post, as well as service facilities like the hospital, Military Personnel, CPAC, DFAS, the post office and the Officers Club. That usage drops dramatically on the weekends, however, to a point below usage at Pence and Tulley Gates. That's basis for the decision to close Walker overnight on Saturday and Sunday, leaving it still operational for 12 hours on those days, and 24 hours Monday-Friday.

As Fort Belvoir completes the transition from contract security personnel to Department of the Army security guards, DES must adjust some aspects of access control. The Army authorizes fewer security guards for Fort Belvoir than had been provided under the contract, which will end this Saturday. As a result, gate staffing must be adjusted to get the most out of the available manpower provided by the Army. Although we have been fortunate in hiring security guards more rapidly than we initially calculated, we will still be under our authorized strength when the changeover is completely in place on Saturday. We anticipate reaching our full authorized strength shortly. Access control will present challenges during the transition as we work to decide the best possible deployment of the gate guard force. We are confident we will strike the right balance.",2013-02-08T12:17:32+0000,534678346563365_6066416,110389852325552,0

Maybe this is something that should be looked into in the future? It seems to be a consistent source of problems here.

While I respect our leaders for making the tough decision to draw down the force, I believe that little attention has been paid to the ramifications. Within the Department of the Army these reductions are not just affecting the Soldiers but, the civilian workforce as well at a time in the United States when there are minimal jobs available. So essentially we are telling our Soldiers, thank you for your service and enjoy unemployment for as long as it last because, while we cared for you on active duty we failed to take care of the economy so their are no jobs when you come home. I'm not saying that we need to foot the bill for all veterans however, if we are discharging someone for not making rank or being substandard, what makes you believe that these individuals will not further hinder the economy. To sum up my point, we are not in the era following WWII when jobs were in abundance after the war, we are in the age of offshoring and importation of goods from other nations leaving no jobs in America. Think about that before making all your cuts and what your impact could be if you had to call these individuals back, for example after President Clinton's drawdown. Do you think they would all answer the call to duty like after 9/11 if America has not taken care of them when they most needed it?",2012-10-05T10:08:46+0000,209525239179016_717127,10202971884392028,1

Security then located the individual and learned that it was a patient carrying a dummy rifle used for training. Security determined that there was no threat, and the All Clear signal was announced. In this particular case, medical staff responded quickly to the Code in an effort to protect patients and staff.

When we moved in I burned candles all the time, but when I had my son I didn't feel safe using candles. I now sell a product called Scentsy, and with the recent fire on Belvoir, I thought I should share it with everyone. Scentsy is a safe alternative to candles, it uses a bulb not a flame. It is safe around babies, and pets. The wax used is food grade so if baby or pet decided to eat it they wouldn't get sick! All you do is plug the ceramic warmer into the wall, turn the switch on, and place your Scentsy wax in the removable top dish, and thats it! There are over 80 scents, and they are all currently on sale! So if you live on Belvoir, you have kids and or pets, and you don't like candles because of the risk of fire, please check out my website, EmilysCommonScents.Scentsy.US, and shop my end of summer party. PRACTICE SAFE SCENTS!",2012-08-21T15:43:19+0000,461026270595240_5426587,10155856218385107,0

They chose to be servicemembers, therfore their service is not a sacrifice. I think we all owe a great deal to those who do dangerous and daunting work on our behalf. From the Soldiers who defend us, to the law enforement who protect us, to the emergency crews who rescue us; we are constantly in debt. Likewise to those who risk their lives, safety and well being to afford us the comforts we have come to expect, we owe respect and debt.

You appear to be rather ungrateful and also seem to not recognize that it was an act of nature not seen in these parts in my lifetime. 

The repairs take time and patience, and you sorely lack one of them. Your attack on the power company comes across as an attack on it's workers who are doing everything they can to get the power back on as quickly and safely as possible. Maybe you should do the math so that you can see that it isn't a city problem, it's not a county problem, it's not a state problem. It's a multi state problem, workers are coming from as far as Texas and Canada to help out. 

You can't fix it and it's your right to pontificate and complain, but I don't see how that is helping the situation. 

I guess my sacrifices are unimportant since my pay doesn't come from tax payers. 

Trust me when I tell you this, if the government was supplying your electricity, it would be a months long outage, not merely a week. Sack up soldier and stop attacking hard working private sector people. Feel free to complain to the utility commission if you want to. In Virginia it's the State Corporation Commission.

USAA offers fantastic coverage for this but sadly ours is through State Farm and we might get coverage if we paid our $500 deductible.

Drivers can always use Pence Gate to head north (or south, of course) on Route 1, or try to alter their patterns and schedules. According to Belvoir's chief of police, drivers who turn left at Walker Gate can get reckless driving charges. The Belvoir PD is trying to keep officers at that location during the ""No Left Turn"" hours and Fairfax County PD will also issue tickets for drivers who try to go the wrong way at the location. ~ms.",2012-04-19T15:21:10+0000,396330580398143_4935819,110389852325552,0

Since the fire in December that a young man passed away and concerns of many residents throughout the villages we decided to move our door to door campaign up to make sure that all the resident who had concerns we could answer their questions. As part of the door to door we offer to check smoke and carbon monoxide detectors to ensure that they are working and are interconnected. We also check dryer vents since this is one of the leading causes of home fires due to lent build up. We also check to see if the resident has fire extinguishers and if they know how to use them. We also hand out fire safety materials and the telephone number to call the fire department and explain if you call 911 that it goes to Fairfax County and routed to Fort Belvoir which could be a delay in time. It?s not that we don?t trust you or being responsible adults. We want to make sure that you and your family is safe.

So, no, it's not exactly the spouse's fault completely.  Secondly, it noted that Mrs Born was not at the Fort.  So, you need to factor in travel time for the causality team to make it to the State she is visiting in.  If the spouse that texted her was not aware of this timely process & had thought she had already been notified on base, she probably sent her sympathy via text for fear that the spouse was overwhelmed with calls.  This article does not state what was in the text.  I'm going to bet this spouse was offering any help she could give, not knowing that she had not been notified.

The info got our quickly so that people were able to know that a threat was there at that moment.If someone wouldnt have posted it in the first place and there was an immediate danger it could have saved someone from being hurt, killed, etc... Villages didnt let anyone know about it till later that night after they said everything was false. Thankfully the Fort Belvoir site jumped on it quickly to get the correct information that there was something going on out there.

These fees fund the program and help to cover the costs of generating materials for Compilers, producing an annual Christmas Bird Count (CBC) summary issue, and maintaining the CBC website and database.  Each registered volunteer is then sent the CBC summary issue which reports all of the results across North America and is broken down into regions and sectors.  The data collected by observers over the past century allow researchers, conservation biologists, and interested individuals to study the long-term health and status of bird populations across North America. In the 1980?s CBC data were used to document the decline of wintering populations of the American Black Duck, after which conservation measures were put into effect to reduce hunting pressure on this species.""",2011-12-22T19:40:34+0000,316572895040579_4321905,10152614496556696,0

It is an early-winter bird census, where thousands of volunteers across the US, Canada and many countries in the Western Hemisphere, go out over a 24 hour period to count birds.  The first CBC was done on Christmas Day of 1900 as an alternative activity to an event called the ?side hunt? where people chose sides, then went out and shot as many birds as they could. The group that came in with the largest number of dead birds won the event. Frank Chapman, a famed ornithologist at the American Museum of Natural History and the editor of Bird-Lore (which became the publication of the National Association of Audubon Societies when that organization formed in 1905) recognized that declining bird populations could not withstand wanton over-hunting, and proposed to count birds on Christmas Day rather than shoot them.""",2011-12-22T19:40:53+0000,316572895040579_4321909,10152614496556696,0

The other jobs were already here. But, a very significant and often overlooked point is that the same BRAC legislation actually REMOVED another 14,500 DOD jobs completely away from the region to other states.

In the final analysis, BRAC has very little to do with the extent to which Northern Virginia is crowded. This region is at the seat of the federal government, and the thousands of federal and contract jobs it takes to run it. We can all better exploit virtualization technology to get traffic off the roads. ~dnc",2011-12-17T15:27:45+0000,282211595164905_3519559,110389852325552,0

@Cathy, no one is more acutely aware than post leadership that Gunston provides the only North-South artery for the post. That's one reason it's being widened. It is also why a second artery is planned that would extend Belvoir Road thru Pence Gate, across Route 1, and onto North Post at Fremont Field. That's going to take some intricate design work and coordination with VDOT and the county, not to mention no small amount of funding.

14953,110389852325552_256573501040519,"Christine, the size and scope of this storm is significant, and its potential to drop significant, flooding rains, coupled with a storm surge that could inundate areas served by the Chesapeake, is very real. Please keep an eye on local media recommendations, as well as Belvoir and local emergency management guidance.

In the tropical cyclone preparedness game, ""Nothing's happened historically"" isn't the best way to plan for what might happen for any given storm. Admittedly, the northward turn this morning, and slightly more eastward track would appear to make chances of significant problems in the DC Metro area somewhat less, but the National Hurricane Center has increased the level of warning for the coast and Bay to that of a Hurricane Warning. 

This storm is significant enough to warrant watching. No, I'm not in NoVa. Yes, I do study tropical cyclones.",2011-08-26T11:02:09+0000,256573501040519_636970,10152541386735003,8

Don't see how this is really an issue of the ""computerized info age."" Really just seems likes its enough for the PX to be sure word is out on the policy of matching lower prices, and that the customers - the ones who will benefit from that - should be the ones to show proof of the competitor's lower price.

Even without them, information is released based on the level of importance determined by a soldier or spouse instead of taking into account the way that information could harm an operation. Social networks simply make it easier to release sensitive unclassified information.

Soldiers and spouses should, at all times, remember that keeping information like troop movements, operation details and personnel status under wraps is tantamount to actively protecting the lives of all the soldiers deployed. Given that, letting information out on a whim is similar to handing the enemy information that could be used directly or indirectly against our servicemembers overseas.

I felt like I was in a morgue or doctors office when going through the Commissary as no one talks to you, not even in response to a hello. I actually smiled when a child would break the silence lol. I agree with Jess about the gates, and other things mentioned.  Housing on main post isn't set up for neighborly interactions, I felt very, very isolated.  Traffic was horrendous.  Woodlawn was run down, and where I lived was falling apart-from what I have seen of new housing there, it looks way better now, and I'm glad you turned my old street into a community center/pool area and that the road goes all around.

There are more civilian than soldiers it seems compared to other posts. Which in my opinion means less oportunities and community events for the families of soldiers when compared to larger posts.  More would help considering to do anything off post in the area takes a lot more money ($8 for a matinee movie unless you wait a month or more for it on post. I try to wait and see movies when at my parents 5 hours away for their $4 matinee). More traffic, traffic, traffic, traffic but we have learned at one times to travel and which routes to take. The post has an older feel to it compared to others. The access to local shopping, events, parks etc. is huge compared to others but again you are going to pay more unless you hit the outlet stores. And the commissary, i believe this statistcally true, is the most busy one anywhere.  I also feel that all boundaries of post should be more secure compared to other post, there are several gaps, but we know with all of the new construction this will not be a priority.  Housing is improving since the last time I have lived here but the new constructions seems very cramped but I have never had any problems with the housing offices as long as you take it to a higher person when getting no results. Example: for those with black mold or any mold, ICE, ICE, ICE! More people see the ICE issues and results are more likly to occur.

built in the area close to the skate park. They will be asphalt and have
lights and fencing. The project has been awarded and the contractor is ready
to start work once the site is ready. Unfortunately the site includes
underground power lines which must be relocated prior to the start of
construction. This work will be done by Dominion Power in the near future.
We anticipate the construction to take approximately 6 weeks if all goes
well and then the courts will cure for 30 days. 

Work is also ongoing to get the 2 additional new courts constructed on north
post. These two are funded and contracted, we are awaiting the necessary
work to get the sites ready for construction.

As updates become available we will pass them on to you - we are indeed
anxious to resume this very popular activity and provide tennis courts for
all ages on Fort Belvoir.",2011-07-08T14:45:33+0000,128404420578728_357232,777733932305604,0

It is an unethical practice that does not prevent or stop speeding ... it merely reacts to speeding.   reactive community policing is poor policing.   A kid being hit by a speeder when a cop is hiding to catch him speeding doesn't save the kid.  If they want to prevent speeding they need to make their presence known and visible to eliminate opportunity, at least that kid would still be alive.  Also it's not like they have anything better to do, they got fairfax county police doing their work on belvoir.",2011-06-10T13:33:03+0000,217625974935272_527451,10202578903940062,0

15667,110389852325552_217625974935272,"I believe safety is a community effort. Defensive and cautious driving is a MUST, especially in residential areas. Teaching and reminding children of safety is also a community effort. Again, this is only my opinion. I do not expect everyone to share it nor do I intend to push my beliefs on others. As a parent and resident I often remind both kids and drivers in my neighborhood to be careful. It's OK to remind a child to ""look both ways"" when you see a little one about to dart without checking.  It's OK to yell ""SLOW DOWN"" to a speeding motorist who pays no mind to postings OR to the kids waiting to cross the street. I would much rather be ""one of those"" people with an eagle eye who isn't afraid to speak up than a citizen filling out a witness report.",2011-06-10T14:58:01+0000,217625974935272_527522,10205322734846916,2

I live on Fort Belvoir and just had to show ID and give address they had a master list and checked that you are a resident. It was totally free for me and my family. It has a wonderful area for the children with a toddler pool and a splash area with sprinklers for kids. Only goes to 6 feet max and had 2 lap lanes blocked off. It is a great addition to the housing amenities. I enjoyed as well as my children. Thanks Pinnacle for a job well done.

Wanting to get in and the Lifeguard looked terrified as he repeatedly told them they were not allowed in. Also a very heated argument between two adult women broke out. They were very close to having a physical altercation and the lifeguards just stood back. They are all teenage lifeguards not MPs or security guards or adults!

We understand that there are some concerns with regards to the new pool at Woodlawn. The Villages at Belvoir would like to assure the residents that all lifeguards on duty are over 18 and that they are all trained in accordance with VA lifeguard and safety regulations. The guards are equipped with a telephone and in an instance where there is an altercation or someone present that is not carrying identification, etc. they will, can, and have contacted the military police. The lifeguards have also been instructed to ask anyone who is not obeying the rules and regulations to vacate the property.  It is our goal to allow all of our residents at The Villages at Belvoir a safe and fun environment to cool off this summer.

By Washington Post Editors
4:55 p.m. Update: One person has died and numerous other people are injured in a multiple vehicle car crash on Route 1 in the Mount Vernon area, Fairfax County police said Monday. The highway is closed in both directions at the scene of the crash.

Fairfax Officer Bud Walker said the crash occurred at 4:02 p.m. in the northbound lanes of Route 1, just prior to the intersection with the Fairfax County Parkway. He had no details on how the crash happened or how many vehicles were involved. He said the gender and age of the person who was killed was not available.

Northbound lanes of Route 1 are completely blocked, Walker said. Southbound traffic is being diverted on to the Fairfax County Parkway. Ambulances were still making their way to the scene at 4:45 p.m.

? Tom Jackman 

Orginal post: An accident at Route 1 and the Fairfax County Parkway may tie up traffic in the area, which is already congested with rush-hour traffic, for several hours, according to emergency officials. 

Authorities say police and rescue crews are on the scene, and drivers should seek alternate routes. 

However, the lack of major surface roads in the area is going to make that difficult, especially if you?re already on the road.

After the last outage, I took note of the radio station and the telephone info line. We do not have internet access during an outage, so we tried the radio station - nothing. The info line kept telling us about some Officer's Club info until several hours into the outage, when the message told us to contact Dominion. Dominion's help line was no better. 

Hope the comms can improve a little bit before the next outage.

With that said, so that hopefully noone bites my head off, let's remember that what is said on this forum is a direct reflection of us as a community.  It is hard to not let our emotions and passions get the best of us, but we do have to be careful and be sure we put our best foot forward.  I actually missed the original posts, so I'm not sure exactly what was said.  But from what I have read here and on the wives page, it certainly does sound like authorities need to look into this, and DO SOMETHING.  If the reasons for not enforcing safety rules relate to problems that have been on going for three years or more, then the ball is being dropped somewhere.

1) The Garrison's decision always applies to the Garrison workforce. The Tenant Commanders/Directors DO have authority to make their own weather calls. Some choose to wait for Garrison; others choose to go with OPM; still others do make their own calls independent of OPM or Garrison.
2) The Garrison does NOT go by the OPM decision - indeed, it is OPM's policy that their decisions do NOT apply to federal agencies outside the beltway. The OPM decision can be useful - but isn't critical - along with other considerations in helping the Garrison decide a course of action.
3) Bottom line is the individual employee certainly has a role to play in their own decision. The employee who just heard on the radio, for example, that his kid's school is dismissing early and will be headed home, probably needs to talk to his supervisor and take a few hours leave to depart post regardless of what his organization or the Garrison might do.",2011-01-28T20:22:22+0000,177863668917703_2306156,110389852325552,1

Stranding of motorists on their way home due to no fault of their own in cold weather should not be overlooked as a safety issue.

However, the comment I was coming on to make was that it is a shame that we've been made public because of an internal debate.  It is comments like Michael's above that caused this dissention and this NEEDS TO STOP NOW!  Michael, I don't know if you have children, but perhaps others need their children to sleep more than 7 1/2 hours per night.  It's not an issue of hearing the bugles, it's an issue of them playing so loudly that they literally wake the children.  As for comments like ""STFU""... is THIS the patriotic spirit and military life you are hoping to encourage?  If so, is it any wonder that the military is in serious want of ""lifers""?  

Please, people, let this go. We've made the papers with our constant bickering.  The issue will soon be passe.  It is time that our country and, especially our military, learn to ""agree to disagree"".  This issue does not deserve such a public display of animosity.  Are we not ALL entitled to our own opinions?  Do we not ALL share a common interest in serving our soldiers, our post, our military and our country?",2011-01-27T15:40:42+0000,106662239408264_127666,965311006828660,4

The main content is quotes taken from this very page, and many of those quotes can be taken out of context as several were pulled from larger and detailed comments/statements. The article's author should have contacted individuals personally who are pro and against ( I realize that most who are against the bugles primarily have issue with the volume and not the bugle calls themselves) and gotten comments that were not fuled by the negative tone of the conversations that instigated the quotes that were used. There should have been information included explaining the purpose of the bugle calls and why they should be expected on a military installation.  
The quote from Lt. Solivan come across in a way that make it seem that the command at Ft. Belvoir is uncaring to the concerns of its residents, when they have been attempting to correct the volume and have even scaled back drastically the number of speakers used. There is also the impression that we as a community are not capable of behaving in a civilized manner and can not discuss this issue without tossing hateful, hurtful, and just down and out nasty commens at each other.

 I respect those of you that like the bugles, I have no problem with them. In fact, I enjoy them when I hear them.  However, I only enjoy them if they don't wake my child.  It's not so easy to move off post with the BAH so low and the cost of living so high.  No one has beomoaned military tradition, but if it becomes tradition to impact our children's health negatively, the Army will lose many more members.  Already there are those of you complaining about the members of the Army that treat this as a ""job"" and not a lifestyle.  Well, seems to me that if you continue to abuse your members and family, this is the reaction you should expect.  

If the bugles are played on a rotating basis on one speaker, any given neighborhood would hear them once every twelve days.  Surely we can understand meeting tradition and caring for families, simultaneously.  Perhaps, being woken once every 12 days would be liveable while still ensuring that others can enjoy their well-loved military traditions?",2011-01-26T21:21:45+0000,189499684413504_2562429,965311006828660,2

17337,110389852325552_189499684413504,"Personally, I'm disappointed.  I've never known the military to ""give in"" so easily. Heck!  When I needed something ""for the health of my children and myself"" I have NEVER had anyone jump so quickly to help me.  But that's a different discussion.

With that said, I do like the idea of rotating the speakers.  I'm not going to pretend to understand the work involved in that, so if that's not possible, then I'd understand.  But I think it might be a very good idea.  

But I have to agree with all of those who are saying this is unfortunate.  In the past, I've done things to try to accomodate things out of my control.  I've always slept with a radio on, for example, for this exact reason.  When I was younger, when my dad was in the military, I slept with a radio to drown out the helicoptors, cannons, etc.  Not too loud, but loud enough that the ""sudden"" noises outside didnt' seem as loud and I was less likely to wake up.  My children now do the same thing and with the exception of my autistic child, sleep through everything!  Even my autistic child banging on the window at 3 am (which is so loud I can and have heard it a block down the road--my apologies to my neighbors).  

I'm not saying that some people haven't tried adjusting their ways to live with the bugles, but to those who just expect everyone around you to accomodate you, that's a shame.",2011-01-26T21:44:29+0000,189499684413504_2562587,10152984910409365,1

As for the Command at Fort Belvoir I am confused by their response to concerns.  There have been hundreds of posts on the subject not to mention all the private emails and calls they are fielding.  There is definitely a legitimate problem that needs to be addressed.  1 or 2 people may be unreasonable complaints that can be overlooked.  Hundreds is an issue and ignoring would be contradictory to good order and discipline and works against the Espirit de Corps among those that live on base.  If there are technical issues and things that need to be worked out the system should be taken off line or reverted back to what it was before they started doing this.  My whole family has been operating off reduced sleep myself included because I have to deal with a wife and kids that are up when they should be sleeping and it is affecting my operational readinies and effectiveness.

As for the school situation, I agree that the communication with the school system could have been better.  FCPS has great communication through the emails and phone calls for most things.  But because their transportation system is a separate entity, as far as transportation is concerned, communication has always been an issue.  My suggestion is some sort of liason between the two entities.  Perhaps the people who run the Belvoir facebook page (sorry not sure who exactly does it but I'm assuming the PAO) could have a liason who is in direction contact with transportation.  Although you'd need to know that transportation is split up according to areas.  Fort Belvoir is under Area 1.  Not sure if this is something that could be done due to limited man power or whatnot.  But it's an idea.  Just so that if buses are running late, parents could check here and find out.",2010-12-17T19:40:40+0000,173023169396339_2104185,10152984910409365,0

17892,110389852325552_111462212254928,"A Lesson That Should Be Taught In All Schools

Back in September of 2005, on the first day of school, Martha Cothren, a social studies school teacher at Robinson High School in Little Rock, did something not to be forgotten.

On the first day of school, with the permission of the school superintendent, the principal and the building supervisor, she removed all of the desks out of her classroom. When the 1st period kids entered the room they discovered that there were no desks.

Looking around, confused, they asked, ?<span>Ms. Cothren , where?re our desks??

She replied, ?You can?t have a desk until you tell me what you have done to earn the right to sit at a desk.?

They thought, ?Well, maybe it?s our grades.?

?No,? she said.

?Maybe it?s our behavior.? She told them, ?No, it?s not even your behavior?

And so, they came and went, the first period, second period, third period. Still no desks in the classroom.

By early afternoon television news crews had started gathering in Ms. Cothren?s classroom to report about this crazy teacher who had taken all the desks out of her room.

The final period of the day came and as the puzzled students found seats on the floor of the deskless classroom.Martha Cothren said, ?Throughout the day no one has been able to tell me just what he/she has done to earn the right to sit at the desks that are ordinarily found in this classroom. Now I am going to tell you.?

At this point, Martha Cothren went over to the door of her classroom and opened it.

Twenty-seven (27) U.S. Veterans, all in uniforms, walked into that classroom, each one carrying a school desk.

The Vets began placing the school desks in rows, and then they would walk over and stand alongside the wall.  By the time the last soldier had set the final desk in place those kids started to understand, perhaps for the first time in their lives, just how the right to sit at those desks had been earned.

Martha said, ?You didn?t earn the right to sit at these desks. These heroes did it for you. They placed the desks here for you. Now, it?s up to you to sit in them. It is your responsibility to learn, to be good students, to be good citizens. They paid the price so that you could have the freedom to get an education. Don?t ever forget it.?",2010-11-11T12:53:21+0000,111462212254928_275427,10203966327574838,0

It wasn't until 11.5 years into our marriage that we finally moved up to 3 whole bedrooms for our weight limit.  The Coast Guard yeoman promotions bottleneck at the E-5 level and it can take many years to move up.  Sometimes they haven't promoted at all.  But, in that time we did have 2 children and I came into the marriage with one.  So, we are a family of five, breaking our backs to move ourselves, leaving things behind as we go.  When we moved out of our home, 30% of what we owned stayed behind and not by choice.  It broke my heart to leave the kids toys, my son's basketball hoop, a train table, patio furniture, desks, an oak and marble hall tree, and more, all left behind.  Plus, things get destroyed, no matter how careful you pack.

You need a freezer, because housing only gives you an apartment size refrigerator unit for a 4 bedroom house and you can't even fit your normal groceries in it.

It is robbery, the way the Army helps less and less each time we PCS.  Thankfully we think ahead and prepare beforehand, but I am astonished at how much more expensive each PCS move gets.

Lets not even get into the cost at the commissary. I understand that in fort belvoir's case most the military here is officers but that doesn't help lower enlisted that is here for one reason or another and it's hurting us on a compassionate reassignment because Dewitt can't handle most of our EFMP's so we are driving to walter reed, bethesda and children's and that adds up...then add in the maintaince of vehicles with oil changes starting at almost 40$ a pop it gets pricey and then you have to juggle what's need the most and pay that while other bills suffer.

Having lived in this area now for almost 7 years, and worked on Belvoir the whole time, often on the night shift I can say without a doubt that Fort Belvoir owns little of that noise.  I've often been surprised at how little noise DOES come from the airfield.  Granted, when the sun starts coming up you can hear some engines winding up and some flights start coming and going, but it is a rare thing to see or hear one in the middle of the night.  
Fairfax County's Helicopters buzz around far more often, making all kinds of racket, but it always makes me feel a bit better knowing that they are up there.

18219,110389852325552_153825914635294,"September 11 is not all a day of mourning to me. It?s a memory of when America as a whole country came together. Helped their neighbors donated  blood, food, anything they could think of. A time where their was no Black, White, Asian, Hispanic we were one all taken back by a single cause. All pushing forward as one complete unit. Showing our love for America and its people by flying flags sending flowers, lighting candles in memory of people we have never met. Crying for the lost of people whom we may have never liked at all. 

The attacks on September 11 2001 is what really inspired me more to join the military. I wanted to be apart of something greater.  To help protect a nation I so deeply cared about. 

I was in 10th grade when everything happen. The school I was in also had us watching the TV. I was scare about what was happening. Later finding out one of the terrorist ate at the same pizza hut my family did the night  before they set their plan into motion on the final day. I was a Jr. firefighter at the time so we were put on alert for days after. I lived on the major incoming and got going traffic for the  Jetport in Portland, Maine and for days to not hear a plane go over was what really sank home something very wrong was happening.

There is one problem though.  The process itself is too long and my husband is currently at Ft. Leonard Wood waiting assignment to his next duty station with our son in a residential facility in Indianapolis for children with behavioral issues, so we are currently waiting for him to get a duty station that fits our sons condition.
Now he graduated 23 June and is sitting around doing details that do not fit what he accomplished in 21R. His SSgt is trying to get his papework rolling with no avail, but it will be a couple of weeks if it will be that.  I am one of many families that is waiting those couple of weeks and my paperwork has been sent in over a month ago, due to Ft. Jackson, SC telling my husband to wait until he gets to his AIT when it states through the EFMP policy that it is to be done when it is to be done when he is processing into basic training.

Imagine my oldest son's schock when he goes from a HS that has not instituted exit exams for his grade and has a great special ed support staff to going to a school demanding 6 SOL""s and very minimal, poor quality support.  

Imagine his schock to realize that the High School is not a place for a ""regular guy"".  They only care about college bound kids, not guys who want to be in service.  They emphasize their ""standard of excellence"", but are not an excellent school.  

I hate the school district here.  HATE, HATE, HATE!.   They are too large and oh so arrogant.  It's like finding your way through a labyrinth, just to get a simple referral.  Forget about trying to go to meetings that are too far away.  

My autistic son (youngest of my 3 sons) does not have the help he needs, either.  The schools do not have rooms for high functioning autistic children.  My son has been utterly miserable to the point of extreme distress this year, because of the ridiculous SOL demands placed on him, as well as the homework that is too hard for him.  There is no place to put him.

I have a daughter, now 23, who was in special ed classes since preschool and we moved a lot also.  The fight that I had to go through at each and every school to develop an effective IEP for her amounted literally to a fight for her life.  

The happy ending I suppose is in knowing that if you keep at it - don't give up - find a productive way to work with school officials on your child's behalf then you will get through it and so will your child.  My daughter just finished her freshman year away at college and absolutely loved it.  It was a very good year for her.

18779,110389852325552_133573389995504,"I have dealt with IEP's in 3 states in 4 school districts.  CA and VA tie for the worst.  But, I will give VA the worst marks, because the district is too big and it's too hard to get ahold of the right people.  Also, because of the intense focus on the SOL""S 

I have been dealing with IEP's for 10 years and with 2 different kids.  I am not new at this.  I am frustrated because we cannot pick where the bases are.  We cannot pick the schools.  We are stuck with what is here and many people hate it. Nearly every parent I have ever spoken to on base hates this school district.  They are doing something really wrong.

My oldest son just graduated last friday.  He finally found a place for himself.  But, his first year was a horrible, depression filled mess and his grades fell.  He rallied thanks to finally finding a place for himself.  He graduated with more success than many teenagers who do not have an IEP.   He had a lot of success in JROTC, spent 2 years on the honor roll, received school related awards, had a super successful novice crew season finishing 3rd in the state, became an Eagle Scout, and much more.  I do not credit the school with this.  He did have some really good teachers (and some really bad ones). But, the school itself .....nope. 

I blame the elementary school for tormenting my autistic child with scholastic demands that he cannot meet.  We are working to change that.  But, these stupid SOL""s should not be forced on autistic children who cannot understand the material.  Apparently, the only way to get my child excused is by getting a letter from his physician.  Apparently, the school administration are powerless to do anything but agree with me.  

I have more than frustration.  My youngest son has been having nightmares and trying to avoid school 2 days a week for months.  Whose fault is that?  I have to request everything.
