BUT this leader also supervises several politically impressionable, young Joes who respect their leaders opinion. These young Joes (with no prior political officiation) friend their leader on social media and are unduly influenced by these posts to vote for a certain candidate. OR, worse a leader directly influences a subordinate to vote a certain way by discussing only their candidates politics at the workplace. 
As difficult as it is to understand to a person without military experience. The military really doesn't want a bunch of drones that don't think for themselves and only follow orders. They want smart, educated, disciplined, people, who can research, problem solve, and come to their own conclusions effectively. The reason these social media, and political rules and regulations are in place is to protect every individuals right to choose who they want to vote for without influence from others. It allows everyone in the DoD the opportunity to maintain their OWN opinion, to research the candidates they want in office, and the ability to place their truest most unbiased vote. 
Granted, to the naked eye it appears DoD muffles freedom of speech as many before you have thought and said time and again. When observed closer, you'll realize it's only done to protect every individuals bigger right to an unbiased political vote which is one of the core foundations of a true democracy.",2016-07-29T18:28:27+0000,10154385513271306_10154388394476306,10205218029149900,1

I think he had paid a lot of police and politicians men in M?xico and some FBI and DEA men, because I have sent e mails and compliances to all this agencies with this information and no one has helped me or even write me back.
He works with a huge group of scammers in M?xico.
They use Facebook and mass media to intimidate the victim; they look for people selling properties, they use real State agencies, in my case: ALATORRE BIENES RA?CES (Jes?s Alatorre) to pay you and steal the money and use your account, stealing previously your ID (IFE), in my case they use Rub?n Luna Bernal as the ""house buyer"", I have papers and videos to prove all these.
First they sent me a ""job offer"" through linkedin from a japanese laboratorie using a friend of my best friend and after a while I accepted and got all my data.
I set a police complaint in PGJ (FDF/T/T3/00772/14-10). 
Since 1 year a go they are threathening my children nephew, they told me (by Facebook notices) they'll cut him in several pieces and send him to me in a box, please help me, I am so scared.
They use army anti terrorist techniques on me.
They said they will kill me and make my death looks like a suicide or as a ""natural"" death from a stroke or an accident.
Also he said he will fire up the place where I am living, no matter how many times I change my location, or even the places that I visit on the street.
I know I will die, but at least I want you to help my family and know who killed me. 
Also the people working for him (threatening me, pushing me, yelling at me) in the street are people with a very very low income or social status.

General Boykin, a founding member of Delta Force and 36-year veteran, was eager to speak to Fort Riley's young soldiers about the importance of faith to the soldier.
This week, following an angry demand by atheist Mikey Weinstein, which actively stalks General Boykin in his stand for military religious freedom, Fort Riley officials promptly canceled the prayer breakfast, citing ""scheduling conflicts."" Not only would the event be ""rescheduled,"" but the official said General Boykin would not be invited back as a speaker.
The message is clear: the men and women in uniform at Fort Riley will not be permitted to hear from one of the Army's own highly decorated heroes because he is unapologetic about his Christian faith.

There is no real good reason to stop a veteran like Gen. Jerry Boykin from speaking to our troops.

You have forgotten the second statement in the First Amendment that gives ALL of us, including military men and women, the free exercise of their religion and free speech.

General Boykin, a founding member of Delta Force and 36-year veteran, was eager to speak to Fort Riley's young soldiers about the importance of faith to the soldier. This week, following an angry demand by atheist Mikey Weinstein, which actively stalks General Boykin in his stand for military religious freedom, Fort Riley officials promptly canceled the prayer breakfast, citing ""scheduling conflicts."" Not only would the event be ""rescheduled,"" but the official said General Boykin would not be invited back as a speaker. The message is clear: the men and women in uniform at Fort Riley will not be permitted to hear from one of the Army's own highly decorated heroes because he is unapologetic about his Christian faith. When military officials are so frightened by anti-Christian activists that they deny Christian soldiers the opportunity to hear from a man who has seen his faith at work in his distinguished career, how do we expect them to respond to the real threats that are facing America today?  I would like to remind all that, by definition, atheist's have no religion and do not believe in religion or a supreme being.

Ethan Allen, Continental Army: 
In capturing Fort Ticonderoga from the British, he demanded surrender: ""In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!""

George Washington, Comander-In-Chief of the Continental Army, US President: 
""While just government protects all in their religious rights, true religion affords to government its surest support"".

""Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of man and citizens"".

John Adams, Signer of the Declaration of Independence and Second President of the United States:
""It is religion and morality alone which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand. The only foundation of a free constitution is pure virtue"".

""We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. . . . Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other"".

William Penn, Founder of Pennsylvania:
""It is impossible that any people of government should ever prosper, where men render not unto God, that which is God's, as well as to Caesar, that which is Caesar's"".

James McHenry, Signer of the Constitution, Secretary of War, namesake of Fort McHenry:
""Public utility pleads most forcibly for the general distribution of the Holy Scriptures. The doctrine they preach, the obligations they impose, the punishment they threaten, the rewards they promise, the stamp and image of divinity they bear, which produces a conviction of their truths, can alone secure to society, order and peace, and to our courts of justice and constitutions of government, purity, stability and usefulness. In vain, without the Bible, we increase penal laws and draw entrenchments around our institutions. Bibles are strong entrenchments. Where they abound, men cannot pursue wicked courses, and at the same time enjoy quiet conscience.

Thomas Jefferson, US President, Signer of Declaration of Independence:
""The doctrines of Jesus are simple, and tend all to the happiness of mankind"".

Benjamin Franklin, Signer of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence:
""Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters"".

""I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men"".

Fisher Ames, Framer of the First Amendment:
""Our liberty depends on our education, our laws, and habits . . . it is founded on morals and religion, whose authority reigns in the heart, and on the influence all these produce on public opinion before that opinion governs rulers"".

John Quincy Adams, Sixth President of the United States:
""There are three points of doctrine the belief of which forms the foundation of all morality. The first is the existence of God; the second is the immortality of the human soul; and the third is a future state of rewards and punishments. Suppose it possible for a man to disbelieve either of these three articles of faith and that man will have no conscience, he will have no other law than that of the tiger or the shark. The laws of man may bind him in chains or may put him to death, but they never can make him wise, virtuous, or happy"".",2016-06-03T16:01:19+0000,10154228022031306_10154232089476306,692269094152511,2

They use Facebook and mass media to intimidate me, they look for people selling properties, they use ALATORRE BIENES RA?CES (Jes?s Alatorre) to pay you, steal the money and use that account to money laundry (stealing previously your ID (IFE), in my case they use Rub?n Luna Bernal as the ""buyer"", I have papers and videos to prove all these.

I live in central avenue #175, Apartment 501, Viena building, De Met unit, colonia San Pedro de los Pinos, M?xico City, M?xico. 
He wants to kill me because I know several of his contacts in M?xico and in NY, and all of them are going to make look my death as a suicide; here some people I know that work for him:
-Ren? Fajer Garfias and Jimena Rodr?guez de Fajer, working in L'oreal NY and living in Manhattan
-V?ctor Job, Havas media group former employee, M?xico City
-Joaqu?n Peralta Hern?ndez, M?xico City 
-Joaqu?n Peralta Guti?rrez, M?xico City 
-Karen Peralta Guti?rrez, Germany
-Ferm?n IV (Pastor in Christian Church named ""Semilla de Mostaza"", M?xico City
-Dileri Anguiano, teacher in Christian Church named ""Semilla de Mostaza"", M?xico City
-Edgar Gerardo Gonz?lez Mac?as (GNP Assurance), M?xico City
-Juan Pablo S?nchez Ramos ""Social"" bar manager in La Condesa manager, M?xico City 
-Setsuko Shiraisi Mouret (Juan Pablo S?nchez Ramos's wife), M?xico City

-Jorge Hern?ndez Molina, ""Dock's restaurant ilegal employee in NY, USA
-Patricia Garc?a Hern?ndez, REMAX employee, M?xico, D.F.
I think he has paid a lot of police and politicians men in M?xico (like Miguel ?ngel Mancera, M?xico city government chief) and some FBI and DEA men, because I have sent e mails and compliances to this agencies with this information and no one has helped me or even answered me, you will find more information in this facebook.
They use Facebook and mass media to intimidate me, they look for people selling properties, they use ALATORRE BIENES RA?CES (Jes?s Alatorre) to pay you, steal the money and use that account to money laundry (stealing previously your ID (IFE), in my case they use Rub?n Luna Bernal as the ""buyer"", I have papers and videos to prove all these.
Besides my  complaint in PGJ (FDF/T/T3/00772/14-10). Since 1 year a go he is threathening my 6 years old nephew, he told me (by Facebook notices) he'll cut him in several pieces and send him to me in a box, please help me, I am so scared, please help me. He is tall, white and fat; he also has a house in R?o de Janeiro, Brasil. He uses army anti terrorist techniques on me.",2016-02-23T23:58:18+0000,10153945577566306_10153945665406306,1441250802863263,0

 DeCA seeks new deli and bakery contractor for 22 commissaries 
By Nancy O?Nell, DeCA public affairs specialist 

FORT LEE, Va. ? Deli and bakery services at 22 commissaries in eight states could be temporarily suspended on March 1 while the Defense Commissary Agency seeks a new contractor. Sixteen of the 22 commissaries have sushi bars that would also be temporarily suspended. DeCA is looking at both long-term and interim solutions to offer the valued deli and bakery services. Using an expedited contracting process, DeCA expects to have a new contract in place by mid-May. 

And as an interim solution, to avoid disruption of services, the Agency is pursuing the use of temporary employees to ensure delivery of limited services until a new contractor can be brought on board.   ""Our goal is to offer our customers high-quality products and services in every aisle of the commissary,"" said Defense Commissary Agency Director and CEO Joseph H. Jeu. ""The difficult decision to not renew the contract option year with one of our current deli and bakery contractors was made in the best interest of our customers."" If a break in deli and bakery services does occur, customers can purchase cold cuts, potato and macaroni salad, fruit and vegetable trays and similar items in their commissary grocery and produce aisles. Store management has increased product quantities and will bring in new items to help fill in any short-term void.  ""We apologize for the inconvenience to our customers,"" Jeu said. ""We're working to return our deli and bakery operations in these impacted stores to normal as quickly as possible.

Commissaries provide a military benefit and make no profit on the sale of merchandise. Authorized patrons purchase items at cost plus a 5-percent surcharge, which covers the costs of building new commissaries and modernizing existing ones. By shopping regularly in the commissary, patrons save an average of 30 percent or more on their purchases compared to commercial prices ? savings amounting to thousands of dollars annually. A core military family support element, and a valued part of military pay and benefits, commissaries contribute to family readiness, enhance the quality of life for America?s military and their families, and help recruit and retain the best and brightest men and women to serve their country.

4579,80248171305_10152888872816306,"There is some confusion as to the rules of the two hour work delay here in my office.  Several of us thought that if we come in at 8 and there is a two hour delay, that means we report at 10 instead.  (Our building is open 6a-6p so some people come in at 6 and some come in at 9 and anywhere in between.  So the 6 person comes in at 8 and the 9 person comes in at 11?)  However, another thought is that you still leave your house at your usual time and take it slow and get to work when you can (maybe 15 minutes late) or however extra long it takes you and as a result you do not get in trouble for being late.  So can you clear that up for us?  What are the rules of the two hour work delay?  Thank you!",2014-12-18T18:45:52+0000,10152888872816306_10152889614751306,10204402940212346,1

FORT RILEY TO HONOR FALLEN GERMAN AND ITALIAN POWs

FORT RILEY, Kan. ? Fort Riley will honor international prisoners of war during a German and Italian Memorial Ceremony at 10 a.m., Thursday, Nov. 20 at the post cemetery.

During World War II, Fort Riley was designated as one of about 600 prisoner of war camps in the U.S. From 1943 to 1946, about 4,500 POWs were incarcerated at Fort Riley, where they performed farm work, road work, laundry services and building maintenance for a stipend of 80 cents per day.

After World War II, some of the POWs stayed in the local area and were later buried at Fort Riley. Today, there are 62 German and 11 Italian POWs interred at the cemetery. 

The annual German and Italian Memorial Ceremony provides an opportunity to continue the international partnership born in war and continued in peace. It also honors former POWs and recognizes their contributions to the heritage of Fort Riley.

Media wishing to cover this event should contact Fort Riley USAG PAO to arrangement for an escort. Please call (785) 239-2022, 239-3358, 239-3033. After 5:30 p.m. call (785) 210-8867. Please RSVP NLT 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 19.

Other times, you can pick up a recommended list of items out put in a kit that you put together based on and tailored to your family members and needs.

There are many many already put together kits being sold on the internet.  Some of those kits I find not worthy of their very high prices.  

I would either call or even better yet, go over to Fort Riley Emergency Management Office and see what they have their to help you.  You can also pay a visit to the Riley County Emergency Management located at 115 North 4th Street on the 2nd Floor.

Also Federal workers ( non military ) earned benefits of on avg 20 $ per hour where private sector  employees earned benefits of 14 $ an hr.

6855,80248171305_10151988705846306,"Part of holding on to the mighty Military defenses of the United States of America is to remember the military is not a democracy. It is an orderly chain of command where all superior authority is obeyed and respected. Whinny soldiers  are not strong soldiers one could count on in a war zone. It is also not a fraternity,  a high school popularity contest , or a  college sorority...where in that would be the only road to promotion. If you are in the military you belong to them  ie GI. It is also important for leaders of any miliatry base to  realize a soldier that has been to war  and survived , is a soldeir  of the finest kind, to respect and use wisely by making sure he or she is teaching the new young soldiers how it all works and how to survive ina war zone. Being in the military is not about being politically correct via the wimpy society standards. It's about being a stronger  part of something greater than ones self and recognizing all the ""Heart Break Ridge"" Gunny's that know & understand what it's all about. Protect our military and our men & women of the military by letting strong leaders train them that truly know what they are doing and what is required. Those that have to be babied, need to be somewhere else. Hang on to those that truly know the realities of war or you will only have inexperienced  babies leading the charge in what ever war deployment they will face. It will not be pretty and history has given that lesson to the USA many times. Experience is the cornerstone to success for any military future to be strong...and for this nation to survive those that would destroy us or any western ideals.

I understand that as soon as it happens, the right people do everything they can to get it back on as soon as possible, and i am very grateful for that. I just think that (again, just my opinion), it is time to start looking into ways to PREVENT it from happening so often. Even if it means schedule  outages. I'm not an electrician, so i honestly have no idea how this could be prevented. I just know that it's quite uncommon for the electricity to go out in such a large area that often.

Yes a couple times the power has gone out for other reasons that it shouldnt be going out, but when its a thunderstorm its excusable.

I hate it too... it has been known to happen other places and seriously its better than a few years ago where no one off post had power for well over a week due to an ice  storm.

You probably don't remember me, sir, but you decided I wasn't good enough for your team on the first day you met me and then you kicked me out of the Army Frivilously.  I had no article 15s in my 5 year career, I had been to iraq and I was on my way to sniper school when I ran into you. The War had damaged my mind and I still had the mind of a child at the time and I was more or less completely unaware of how sick I was.  Even so, You treated me like hated slave.  You worked me from 5 am to 12 am and then I would have to drive home for a couple hours and then head back in.  You made the chaplain tell me that my wife was going to leave me and that I would never get hired anywhere, he also asked me how many times I masturbated per week.  You humiliated me and disgraced me, adding to my mental disturbance.   I left the army crazy and hallucinating and I became homeless for awhile until I was able to continue mental health care for the disorder that was in my record when you kicked me out of the army instead of recognizing that I was a good soldier in need of help. I challenged you to combatives and you declined.  I still remember you, Clark, and My offer is still open.  If you have a hair on your nutsack, come see me.

7420,80248171305_10151698562276306,"We are no longer at fort riley but here are a few tips we learned when living their with power issues every summer.  Cover upstairs windows with blackout curtains or thick blankets you use for winter on the inside of the provided white shades,  this keeps the place much cooler.  if temps get near 100 prepare for power failure.  Keep water bottles frozen in your freezer. turn the a down a bit, cover all windows down stairs the same way you keep the upstairs you can take the down stairs ones down once the temp drops.  This keeps the house much cooler when power goes out by blocking the sun. When power fails  stay outside until nightfall sprinklers are great. Move milk to the freezer.  The frozen water bottles can be used to keep cool and hydrated power is usually fixed by end of the night.",2013-07-10T01:51:15+0000,10151698562276306_27394456,728423800543056,22

7479,80248171305_10151670917661306,"We apprecaite the comments and concerns on this status update! The experts at Fort Riley's Directorate of Public Works shared with us a few points to consider about roundabouts. This information was posted in the 1st Infantry Division Post newspaper, but we think it is important to share here, too: 

Roundabouts are traditionally safer than traffic circles and intersections with traffic lights because fewer accidents occur in roundabouts. The accidents that do occur are typically less severe than those that occur at traffic circles and signalized intersections. 

Roundabouts are also safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Roundabouts improve traffic flow and can accommodate U-turns. 

Roundabouts are more environmentally friendly because they do not require electricity and result in less gas usage due to stop and start traffic flow. Roundabouts can also function during power outages.",2013-06-26T20:48:52+0000,10151670917661306_27242656,80248171305,2

7481,80248171305_10151670917661306,Thank you for explaining the purpose of the roundabouts! I thought it was for cosmetic purposes only. Now I am curious to know just how many accidents (both severe and minor) actually happen on Fort Riley seeing as a majority of  the speed limits on post are already sorely limited?

I would be more concerned with trapping and testing mosquitoes where people are living, playing and working. The low laying areas around the Forsyth main park by the neighborhood center seem to come to mind immediately. Being familiar with the types of environments that mosquitoes like to live and breed, the lack of adequate drainage, in an area where people are playing every day, especially small children would seem like a place to start trapping, testing and spraying. I'm sure Forsyth isn't the only neighborhood with drainage issues but since our yard backs up to that commons area and we frequently walk to the park we are aware of this every day problem. To me this would be an area of prime concern. Please keep us informed on when, where and any new developments with this situation for those of us who cannot and are not able to join the live discussion.

Its Good Friday, so schools (on post) are out of session and most soldiers have a 4-day due to Easter. Nay-sayers only call for organizations to not wish to do things like this in the future.

I personally do appreciate their attempt and have taken my kids to this event the past 3 Aprils.  That being said, if the event is for the kids wouldn't it make sense to have it at a time when more parents would be done work and able to take them to it?  Yes, school is out on Fort Riley & it's a 4-day for soldiers but what about the kids who go to school off post and the parents who still work even when soldiers have a 4-day?

8722,80248171305_10150337338114221,"Thank you all for voicing your concerns. I encourage you to visit our local Army Community Services, Building 7264 on Custer Hill on Normandy Drive. ACS has many programs that are free and available to military Families that address your very concerns - program include: New Parent Support, Financial Readiness, Relocation Readiness, Deployment and Mobilization Support and more! You also can call 785-239-9435 or visit www.rileymwr.com to learn about any of these program. 

Another program I would highly recommend is the Resilient Spouse Academy. The next session will be in January and addresses issues to include financial readiness, suicide prevention, substance abuse and domestic violence prevention. The program is aimed to provide you with skills to cope and succeed despite the stressors of military life. A similar program - Resilient Youth Academy - is geared toward children and will take place in November and in March. To learn about RSA/RYA, contact Julie Zwiebel at 785-239-9435.

Like suggested in the column, we would love for you to get involved and voice your concerns through official outlets. AFAP is a great example discussed in the column above.

That made me feel really ""good"" because if 11 years ago is old school than I'm from the ancient school army.  I visited Hickam airforce base on vaction and went to the housing we used to reside in during the 1970s...hasn't changed a bit.  Housing has made some great strides over the 20+ years I've been kicking around, but my soldiers prior to this deployment still lived in the same billeting standard I had 20 years ago.  We also have invited my single soldiers over quite a few times around Thanksgiving.  I remember how depressing it was to spend holidays at the barracks, especially as a new arrival to the unit.

8735,80248171305_10150337338114221,"Ok, just wanted to say a few more things--I was on my phone earlier, hence the super short reply.

First of all, we don't ""know it all"" nor are we ""stuck up"". We're sharing things with you that have been shared with us at some point or another. Or that we've learned by observing other women. Michelle didn't know everything when she started out either--but considering she's been at this gig since you were about a year old, I'd say she knows a thing or two about being an Army Wife and has earned the right to share what she's learned. I can also vouch for the fact that she's not stuck up in the least bit. 

As far as I go, I'm new to the wife aspect of this but I kind of got a head start being a Navy brat and dealing with deployments from a young age.

None of us would disagree that emotional support is absolutely imperative during these years apart. The Army has set up outlets to find such support but you have already made it very clear in previous online discussions that you want nothing to do with the FRG. Unfortunately, by refusing to utilize that very valuable resource, you're completely limiting yourself in the amount of support you could find. If you have issues with the FRG, the best way to deal with those is to join it, be an active part of it and strive to change whatever negative perceptions you might have had. 

As far as the other issues you raised (taking out trash, bills, juggling life as a single mom with a young child..), the Army isn't obligated to help us with those. Single moms deal with these issues every day of the year, military or not. The single moms outside the military just don't have an end date in sight for their stress and for that, my hat is off to them. These are areas in which we have to learn to adapt and be independent. You learn to run the trash out while your child is napping--trash bag in one hand, baby monitor in the other. You learn that 26 pounds isn't really that much to wear around on your back (the carriers are generally rated to over 40) and you learn to view it as bonding time AND a good workout! You learn how to use a crock pot so you don't have to think about cooking meals with a baby underfoot. And most of all, you network through your FRG so you have friends who you can trade off childcare with--so you don't go totally insane. 

These are things women all over the world have to deal with, the main difference being that a lot of those women don't have the close community of the Army to learn from or support them. Add to that the fact that a good majority of those women are working full time jobs on top of taking care of children. It's part of being an adult and being an independent spouse. Is it fun? Generally, no, though having a baby on my back while I haul in groceries is so second nature by now that I don't even notice. But it is absolutely possible if you're willing to just work with your circumstances and take the responsibility on yourself instead of putting it on the Army. 

Again, I'm not saying this because I think I'm better than you. I'm saying this to encourage you and the others you refer to to become more self sufficient in matters of personal responsibility. It's a steep learning curve, but thousands of women have done it more times than you or I have and they have managed quite well.",2011-10-15T01:55:34+0000,10150337338114221_19112024,10202532388579583,4

We have the FRG, multiple classes and training for spouses and good old fashioned advice from women who have ""been there done that"". This post is actually really great where these things are concerned! Just check the monthly schedules that get posted either on this page or on our unit page! Not only are these events informative, they serve as great forums for networking with other wives. One of the best opportunities for first-timers was/is the Resilient Spouse Academy. The resources are there but you have to utilize them! (I realize you've figured out what works for you, so when I say ""you"", I'm using it an all-inclusive sense)

On top of that, spouses of deployed soldiers get an allotted amount of free childcare hours on post so they CAN attend these classes and get-togethers. 

Our FRG (yes, you and I are in the same unit) is wonderful, incredibly informative and very welcoming. I have personally learned a ton from these women and it's largely because of their advice and encouragement that this deployment has gone so smoothly. 

I understand that not all FRGs are created equal, but as we've said previously, the best way to remedy issues you see with them is to become involved. 

As far as your charge that many wives ""act like they have no weakness"": There isn't one army wife that doesn't have some sort of weakness. However, it's completely normal to develop a pretty thick skin. You have to. I know for myself, I rarely discuss negative things that are going on in my life with anyone but my dearest friends. Keeping a positive attitude around the general public and my fellow Army wives helps keep morale up and foster a healthy, happy environment. So yes, to you, Desiree, it might look like I or [insert name] have no weaknesses or problems but trust me, we all do. We're just judicious about who we share them with. 

Here's what I would encourage you to do: try going to an FRG meeting. It's not going to kill you. Try meeting some other gals in the unit and go into it without painting everyone as ""stuck up"", ""thinks they're perfect"", or ""knows it all"". I think you'll see that there are a lot more resources available to spouses than you currently realize and it will also give you a chance to get involved and share what has worked for you this past year. More programs are no replacement for the life experience of wives who have gone before us and eventually, WE will be those wives.",2011-10-15T05:04:52+0000,10150337338114221_19113710,10202532388579583,1

The community of Manhattan is trying to build highway expansion that will allow eaiser access, but from my experience going through the Ogden gate; it is the fact there is too much traffic trying to use the four roads (none of which allow fast access anywhere) to get onto the hill that cause the jams.  I've been assigned to Riley for 2 years (one in Iraq) and I was hoping to get reassigned just to get away from ""Cluster"" hill.",2011-10-11T16:19:34+0000,185006821576922_1203256,10204529853154205,0

I realize funding is a concern, but I think it is the responsibility to take care of their soldiers starting at the lowest rank.

Specifically on military pay:
Active and Reserve military members will be paid on time for pay earned pr...ior to the expiration of the CRA (midnight April 8) -- approximately half of their normal mid-month payment. Active duty military and on-duty reservists cannot be paid for duty performed after the CRA expired, until additional legislation is enacted. Once another CRA or an appropriations act is signed into law, normal disbursement of pay will resume for pay earned after employees return to work.

The decision to restructure rank bands at Fort Riley is part of an overall program that will result in better customer service to families living on post. This change in rank bands aligns with what is in place at other Picerne installations, allows for better prediction of wait list times and will open up available housing to accommodate the needs of growing  populations wishing to live on post.

It is important to remember that we are in the fourth year of an 10-year Initial Development Plan. At the end of this phase, all neighborhoods will be restructured with each rank band having its own dedicated sub-neighborhood. While we understand your frustrations with this lengthy process, we ask your patience as we move forward with plans to improve the homes and neighborhoods at Fort Riley.",2011-04-04T15:10:19+0000,10150123923071306_16046993,80248171305,0

I even installed a thermostat timer on my own dime.  
The questions that I have are: 1. Is this study made public?  2.  Does this study take into account for those like homes that have small kids, or don?t have full time custody of their kids, or the spouse works full time with the kids going to school all day, or the tenants have possession but are not staying fulltime at the house because spouse is deployed?

We did move a few dinners intentionally, as attendance is only 50% when the dinner is on a training holiday weekend, so it gets moved to the day before the training holiday. Your best bet is to check out our 2011 flyer on www.facebook.com/usoftriley for all the dates. 

Thanks for asking!",2011-01-29T00:26:17+0000,196513690363841_2711847,10203876904057892,0

The people that do this for the military are awesome! 

Why do people have to make things bigger then what it is, it is a race car that most people don't get chance to see up close.

Suzanne:
It has nothing to do with alcohol do you really think kids are going to see a car because it has a sponsor of alcohol NO!  Most kids don't even know what Crown Royal is. The time it was there most kids are in school. Kids that drink or drugs or smokes they need better parenting and parents that are being active in where their kids are and what they are doing.  Yes it would be better if there was a car that had a different sponsor or a hand out for kids to not drink.

We bought alarms to go on our doors so we can hear if they open the door. They were $9 for 2 alarms. Not hard to install at all. I think there should be a fine of some sort for these irresponsible parents that dont care. Its ridiculous. We had three kids playing in the sewer ditches that we knew had glass and nails etc in it. They were also climbing into the tubes that goes under he road. I called and the MPs never showed up.

He said 2 years ago, make sure you listen. Sec. Gates has served as Sec Def since 2006....

I apologize that you had to read the comments by PV2 Swicegood.  I am even more upset for those spouses who attended the event today and represented the Soldiers of our entire unit in an INCREDIBLE fashion.  

They had a very special hour today with the senior most executive in the Department of Defense, yet instead of sharing some of the great stories of those who had this opportunity, we instead are diverted to focusing on the opinions of a young Soldier who has been on the ground at Fort Riley a grand total of 2 days, and therefore probably in the Army for less than a year, and on his first installation other than the location of his basic and AIT.

So take it all for what its worth and use that to put his comments in context.  Not only did he not communicate in a way that properly represents the great folks here, he also has absolutely no credibility to say anything sensible about what Fort Riley has to offer, or the decision making of our Senior Leaders.

Again, I apologize to all of you for him.

Would like you to understand that we have 8,000 families at Fort Riley and that the Secretary of Defense made a last minute adjustment to his itinerary in order to meet spouses of Fort Riley.   Therefore, this was not the kind of thing that we could have simply have publicized for open seating, so we quickly assembled 115 spouses by asking the chain of command to identify 2 or 3 spouses from every battalion on Fort Riley across all ranks.  In fact, normally he likes to meet with 6 or 8 spouses ... what if we'd not taken a shot at the full town hall and he only met with 6 or 8?  I would hope instead that you could be happy for those that got to attend.

As McKenna noted, we had representation from every rank on the installation, and every unit.  There is always the possibility that someone would feel left out, but I hope what you understand is that we went through a very deliberate process to insure everyone was fairly represented, rather than making accusations that people were purposely left out.  The mix of spouses was completely representative.  Bad blood only comes when you don't trust that the folks here aren't against you - they're with you.  We only gave folks about 36 hours to get us the names because of the late breaking opportunity.  I hope this helps you understand better.

10217,80248171305_744116782011,"Here is how it worked:  Each battalion had a limited number of slots available, and the spouses they were able to invite had to fit into a certain demographic.  For example; our battalion was able to invite one jr. enlisted spouse, one enlisted spouse, and one company grade officer spouse.  This was done to insure that the audience was an accurate representation of the spouses on post.  Space was limited, and, in my opinion, invites were issued on the fairest basis possible.  The powers that be did not have a lot of notice beforehand that this town hall would even be taking place, and they did the best they could to make sure that all Fort Riley Spouses were represented.  
Please remember that it was a priviledge to have the Secretary of Defense take the time to meet with the spouses of Fort Riley, and that every effort was made to make sure that we; even those who were not invited; were all well represented!  The spouses who were there spoke out on behalf of all of us, and they did so in a way that should make us all feel proud.  ",2010-05-09T05:35:37+0000,744116782011_836606,1306218759397499,0

I missed some ecstasy during my childhood, because I would think other guys and gals were not being ?up-rooted? every three to five years. I could always bemoan the constant separation from childhood friends (oh how I wish they had this during my childhood). However, the landscapes, different foods (while dad was stationed in Japan), meeting people from different backgrounds and cultures, and the military family togetherness are enormous joys in my life. 

Sometimes during my teen years, I would think of these joys, other times I acted like any other teenager??they do not understand.? Yet today, I have a peace in life. Is it getting older? Yes, that is part of it, but my Military Childhood gave me the essence of survival, caring, seeing what is in front of me, and enjoying what I have (since it is all transient anyways). I hope all military children enjoy all they can while they can, because our fathers chose to be one of Uncle Sam?s children and we as kids were along for the ride?SO I ENJOYED IT.

Again, like the others posted, you have to pay for all damages when you move.  So why make a pet deposit.  I live on a street, on post where NO ONE takes care of their animals, and I have seen two of the houses..BEYOND GROSS!!!  But, housing knew about the issues, and yet nothing was done. Animals were taken away for about a week, then given back. ?? Made no sense, and again the same issue took place..

If you don't like the system, buy your own house and move off post. I don't know what other bills some people are complaining about, but living on post your electric, water, trash, and heat is all included in your BAH (unless you go over a set amount). You are essentially getting a break from paying all the bills that you would pay if you lived off post. Just pay the amount and move on.",2010-03-16T02:25:24+0000,424283184128_12924446,908298565857293,0
10443,80248171305_424283184128,"I don't mind paying the deposit though it seems redundant. How many people do you know stay where they're at even if they can barely afford the cost because they can't afford to pay deposits and moving costs? The problem will be for those who have to live off post due to the LONG waiting lists for for houses and paying the HUGE rent cost + living expenses then trying to have the extra $150 plus all the costs of moving. There will be people either putting their animals in pounds or worse, lying, or suffering because they can't afford the deposit and the move. You don't have to worry about moving costs when you first move to a new base. If there isn't housing available when a family first gets to any new base, Housing should pay for the move onto post when they do have houses available.Then the family could use the money they save to pay the pet deposit.

10444,80248171305_424283184128,"kris, you should compare the pay and benefits of Soldiers to firemen and policemen and you will see that we have it way better then they do. I actually looked into this and found that a fireman with 5 years  makes about $40, 000 a year and a sgt with 5 years in the Army here at Ft Riley makes around $50,000 a year not including medical, dental, and vision which is also free for you. If you are a Soldier then you know that nobody gets punished to the full extent of the law or UCMJ for that matter. I chose to live off post for my own reasons, but where i live i paid a $550 pet deposit and put up a $1400 privacy fence to keep my dogs safe and provide a safe place for them to run and play. what picerne is trying to do is protect and preserve the housing so that we can all have a good, clean and safe place to live if we chose to live on post.",2010-03-17T01:44:05+0000,424283184128_12978672,10204586795418567,0

The problem is... the responsible pet owners will be the honest ones... the irresposible ones will not tell them they have a pet.

Our experienced prepares might be aware of other tax benefits that you might be eligible for that some of these home software programs don't tell you about.   We are located in building 7826 across from Normandy Chapel the corner of Normandy and Hale.  We are open from 8-6 M-F and 9-1 on Saturday.  We have an equal number of prepares doing scheduled clients and walk-ins.  Saturday is strictly walk-ins.  The tax center is able to file 2007, 2008 and 2009 federal returns and all state returns. We are able to e-file directly with the IRS allowing you to get your refund within 10-14 working days.  You do need to bring social security cards for all people on your return but if you don't have them you can always get a verified letter from the Social Security office in Manhattan, KS.    If your spouse is deployed you can still file if you have a Special or General Power of Attorney.  If you are expecting a refund I suggest you file as soon as possible and if you have a tax liability I suggest you wait until the last day possible to pay.  I will continue to monitor this page for any comments, concerns or questions.  Thanks.  -- Elizabeth Thurston",2010-01-25T15:11:35+0000,265377399220_10200614,10152149001662434,0

Stay true to who you are, and dont believe the rumor mill, it will only make things worse.  As everyone else said, dont over communicate, we want to know whats going one but we really dont need to know that your out of milk and eggs.  If you overspend because  some of the savings you where planning on making, be honest about spending and tell them what it was for, a good spouse will always understand.  I believe the spouse at home has it much worse, we get feed without cooking or cleaning up, our laundry, for the most part is done for us, and we drive military vehicles that we dont have to pay for when they break down.

So the two gyms will be open but with limited services.

Also, there are 2 daycare centers open, and their purpose for being open is so that mission essential workers can still be provided a daycare option.  That said, there will be some limited hourly day care space on a first come, first served basis - those two CDCs are Whitside and Warren.  Enjoy the day - hopefully it all lines up for you

However, I would point out that Mary's comment above is exactly right.  

My hope is that you realize there are real humans that are thinking all the tiime about how to take care of all Soldiers, Families and Civilians - no one is purposely or consciously excluding you or considering folks like you as not ""important enough"".  If  you have some suggestions, I'd like to hear them - I watched a workgroup assemble today with people from all across Fort Riley Service providers seeking ways to do better - give them a chance, and give them your opinions - and maybe we can fix whatever it is you think isn't working right.

11029,80248171305_104593664411,"I am aware of this concern and looking into it - While we are looking into ways to best do this, I have a similar/related question - would it be of any use to you if there were ""spouses only"" hours at a fitness center?  I am considering this for King Field House - probably a mid-late morning block of time - and we might be able to include your child care idea /concern as a part of that.  We couldn't do it at all fitness centers, but possibly focus it at one.  Also, the new neighborhood centers being built by Picerne will include cardio rooms with a viewable adjacent play area.

Thanks for your inputs

11033,80248171305_104593664411,"COL Brown, I live off post so the neighborhood center solution won't work for me but is a good option for those on post.

11034,80248171305_104593664411,"Just so everyone knows, hourly care at the Warren Road East CDC is a great childcare alternative.  Your children have to be registered on post and the cost is 2.50 to 3.50 per hour.  Since they have opened this facility alot more slots have opened.  I know it is inconvenient to have to pay for it, but the gyms on the hill are a short drive and King Field House is only 10 minutes away.  Also, space is VERY limited at King Field House and we ALL need to realize that if  a child care facility is put in there that we will most likely have to say goodbye to the skating rink.",2009-07-31T20:57:59+0000,104593664411_3450384,10206347968717917,0
11035,80248171305_104593664411,"Thanks Tara - there are definitely good options for childcare already.  What I'm trying to get a feel for is whether childcare in the fitness center would make a difference.  I think for some, if we could help cut out those 10 or 20 minutes going to and from childcare, it might help a few more spouses get freed up just long enough to get to the gym and back for a short period.  Still, you're right, for those that aren't pressed for time, Warren is a great choice.
