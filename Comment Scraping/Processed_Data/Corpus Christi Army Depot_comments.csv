As a former ccadder I've noticed once again that the members from the Industrial & Engineering Teams who often go above and beyond in their daily maintenance of all equipment throughout the base are left unrecognized. I worked on Team One for Mr. Emede Canales a few years and found that even though we did Outstanding work in keeping with the highest tradition of the U.S. ARMY and DoD we were even then left out like an unwanted step child. At the time I worked with and trained some outstanding men. It is hard to comprehend that these folks still go unnoticed. I wish I were still there maintaining such fine equipment, and working along many fine trades personnel. But due to family health issues and being the senior member of my wonderful family I was forced to take a thirty thousand dollar cut in pay to come home and help make some important decisions. Tp my former Teammates, wish I were there with you. Keep a positive attitude and keep the Warfighter moving forward.

1479,127503813936902_893864417300834,"We couldn't agree more, Mr. Jhon Ruiz. We consider all our contractors a part of our CCAD team. In fact, when we refer to CCAD as a ""team,"" we have never meant it to mean only our federal employees. The term, ""CCAD team"" was created to embody the partnership and collaboration of our civilian workforce, our contractors and OEMs, our military, and others who play a special role in our daily mission. We can have a helicopter in one stage of production being worked by a contractor, a reservist, a federal employee, and a National Guard in annual training in a single day. There is simply no way to single out our appreciation for the quality of work performed here. CCAD is and always will be a team. We have been fortunate to work with some of the most dedicated, skilled and knowledgeable talent in the business and we have our contractors to thank for much of that. So, when you hear the leaders thanking the team, know that they're thanking you, too, because they are. 

Now, from a Public Affairs standpoint, we want to hear our contractors' stories and share recognition with the rest of the team and the aviation community. Send Public Affairs your good news stories and photos, if you have one, and we'll make sure your folks get the recognition they deserve. You can send to us, directly, or have your supervisor send it.

CORPUS CHRISTI (Kiii News) - The Nueces County Medical Examiner identified Friday the two victims in what police believe may have been a murder-suicide that took place in this city's southside Thursday evening.

It was around 3:40 p.m. Thursday when police were called out to the 8000 block of Etienne Drive in the Kings Crossing area after receiving reports of shots fired in the area. Once there, officers discovered the body of 42-year old Patricia Askew laying in the street and 51-year old David Askew near the front door of a house. Both had apparent gunshot wounds.

Police called for EMS crews from the Corpus Christi Fire Department to treat the man and woman, but both were pronounced dead at the scene.

Investigators say they have no information to support the possibility of a third person involved in the shooting. The investigation is ongoing.

If you have any information that could help police, call the Corpus Christi Police Department's Criminal Investigations Division at 361-886-2841.",2014-09-26T19:23:26+0000,808500245837252_808557825831494,782814435075126,0

Unfortunately, it is forbidden to take photos and post them. That's fine. I can live within the requirements just fine. I do wonder, however, why CCAD hasn't posted on their FB page a series of photos approved for release to the public? I know that PAO has a large number of photographs that have been approved for release over the years. Post them here. Let us come and copy them for sharing with out friends and families. All we see posted here is folks getting awards and feeding their faces.

Enough of pork belly spending, frivolous spending, enough with the billions of dollars going over seas to aid other countries hungry, and destitute.
