I started as a 72G.. Reclassified 74C as MOS continued to be restructured. Ok.. None of us liked it at the time, because we took it personally. 

Some years after I'd left the military, I looked into my old MOS. 

It turned out.. By coincidence or otherwise, my civilian career continued to parallel my military start.. 

My original MOS became a Cisco certification qualified field of expertise. 

.. Or perhaps the military followed me ;-)

These days? I've moved into expanding my security qualifications into a solid expertise. 

Another hat to wear.

If you are a visitor traveling in a vehicle with a DoD ID card holder you are considered a trusted visitor, no matter what state the license is from, as long as it is valid. If you are a visitor traveling without a DoD ID card holder you need to stop at the visitor's center to acquire a visitor's pass. At this time any valid state driver's license will work, until further guidance comes down from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).",2016-01-26T15:10:06+0000,994650123943845_995090587233132,355931204482410,0

If you are a visitor traveling in a vehicle with a DoD ID card holder you are considered a trusted visitor, no matter what state the license is from, as long as it is valid. If you are a visitor traveling without a DoD ID card holder you need to stop at the visitor's center to acquire a visitor's pass. At this time any valid state driver's license will work, until further guidance comes down from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).",2016-01-26T15:12:55+0000,988182237923967_995091620566362,355931204482410,0

While the show is partially funded with NAF dollars (those monies generated by MWR programs like bowling or causal dining on installations) the Soldiers are all paid with APF funds, the salaries of the permanent Soldier Show staff are converted APF dollars, and the garrisons spend tens of thousands of dollars each time the show comes to their installation on lodging, food, security, advertising, and other incidentals related to the show. Just as importantly, it takes soldiers from their units, leaving allocated slots than can't be filed for the duration of the tour. It was 100% a resource management decision, made at a DA-level budget meeting, not here at IMCOM HQ. We will honor the decision and do our best to find new, innovative ways to support our Soldiers and the Total Army Family.",2016-01-11T21:16:09+0000,986602484748609_986603948081796,355931204482410,1

It used to be if you dined in the chow halls your meals were free but they found that giving each member an allowance and a choice worked out better. Every member is entitled to this (officers get less) I feel that the base pay for our service members, especially younger service members could be higher. But honestly, we get a wage, housing or an allowance for housing, money for meals (I can feed my family of 4 with the BAS if I had to, and I have had to, by being coupon savvy and only buying things on sale), and very low cost health care. There are also ""special pays"" and allowances for being in certain jobs as well as re-enlistment bonuses. You are not going to find a civilian job that gives you all your basics.

3284,355931204482410_650540568354804,"I am glad the Army has chosen Fort Gordon for the new Cyber Command headquarters. The news media has been saying that 1500 new personnel (maybe families) will be relocating to the Augusta area. Lincoln County officials have stated that they are expecting an increase in population in the county due to the headquarters. I'd like to inform prospective home buyers that Lincoln County is not the place you want to move if property taxes are a concern to you. From what I've read in the Lincoln Journal, Lincoln County has the highest property taxes around, property tax assessments are not fair. The entire property tax system in Lincoln County seems to be flawed and county officials don't seem to care. So, if you're planning on looking at purchasing real estate in Lincoln County, please do your homework and consult with your realtor and get an appraisal before you buy. Appraisals are about $350.00 but might save you thousands on the purchase price. I'd stay away from Lincoln County.

That way you could utilize the specific agency's social media following to address issues relevant to them.

4222,355931204482410_551933928215469,"Pro-tip: you cannot claim the tax exemption if you are registered to vote in Georgia. They don't tell you this at the DMV when getting a license. They just ask if you would like to register to vote, then when you show up at the tax commissioner/tag office you get hit with a substantial tax liability to register your car. Out of state w/tax exemption carries little fees, and even cheaper if you get a military tag (IE-OIF veteran, retired Army, etc...) 

Registering to vote at the DMV or elsewhere implies intent to become a Georgia resident and thus negates the tax exemption status due to military duty. This is on the page linked above but merits highlighting.

Another note for those new inbounds: you must have a Georgia title to get Georgia plates. If you have a car loan, plan ahead to leave time for title transfer actions before your registration expires. Sometimes it takes a few weeks for title transfer (especially in states that keep electronic titles vs paper copies and financial institutions that have a stack of paperwork for title transfers and demand processing fees) and you can't get tags until that's complete.",2013-11-12T23:31:44+0000,551933928215469_1585875,1134795143204700,1

I agree that PCS moves are a requirement of military service when a particular assignment (schools, specialized fields, etc...) requires it, but many mid-grade NCO assignments can be accomplished at the same post. Does the SSG need instructor time? An inter-post transfer to the AIT world and instructor training gets that done. Recruiter a career booster? The CSRA has more recruiting stations than I can count. Platoon sergeant time? Any unit on post with the Soldiers MOS can put him or her on the battle roster where he can compete for that developmental position.",2013-10-31T00:22:37+0000,545105715564957_1564195,10204885409641147,0
4275,355931204482410_545105715564957,"Of course a Soldier needs to consider moving on at some point to broaden experience (IE- 20 years at Fort Gordon limits exposure to different communities in DoD), but a move every few years is unnecessary for assignment broadening. Fiscal considerations aside, you have to think that a PCS move is a hardship on families and has significant manpower costs. A stateside PCS takes a Soldier out of the loop for about 2 months minimum. Conducting turnover with your replacement, clearing post, travel time, PTDY, inprocessing, acclimation, holdover status, and the logistical strain of moving household goods (with all the necessary paperwork) are all manpower expenses the government pays every time they move a Soldier. If the Soldier can get broadening by doing an inter-post transfer to a different type of unit on the same installation, why is that a bad thing?",2013-10-31T00:23:03+0000,545105715564957_1564196,10204885409641147,0

""In the fall of 2013, the U.S. Army has closed after 67 years, another large garrison in West Germany: the Garrison Baden-W?rttemberg - and her heart: Heidelberg. About 18,000 military personnel in the region Heidelberg-Mannheim were resettled - a historic incision. With the withdrawal of the U.S. Army in West Germany a defining chapter of German-American history comes to an end. What does this deduction for those who leave Baden-W?rttemberg and Germany? What does it mean for the German neighbors, friends, life partners and business partners?""

4704,355931204482410_501665133242349,"As an employee the furlough has hit pretty hard considering both myself and my spouse are DoD employees.  Not only has it put a financial burden on us as employees,  the Furlough has put increased stress on our service members and their families.  Moving from post to post is stressful enough without the added problems of office closures one day a week and having to try and get in and out processed from post to post.  Family is important, especially when you have been away from yours for a while.  Trying to get your family moved, get settled and meet deadlines only to find you can't get things done because of office closures adds unnecessary stress to an already stressful situation.  Unless you have sat across the desk from a weary soldier who just made it home from Afghanistan who is trying to find housing for his family to get them to where he is, or a brand new soldier who is just trying to figure things out, you can't really understand the frustration office closures cause when their plans have to be delayed.  Until you have sat with a wounded warrior who needs to clear post on a day your office is closed and see the pain in his/her eyes when you have to tell them they will be delayed until the office opens on Monday you really can't understand; because now this already wounded warrior is going to incur an additional financial burden of a hotel room waiting for your office to open so he/she can clear.

Plus we can stay up to date about gate forclosures, bad weather, and emeregency situations that may occur. And when all else fails the town hall meetings are open and ready for any concerns that I've ever had.

To clarify, 'military brat' is not an insult. For many, including myself, it's a 'badge of honor' and term of endearment and respect, symbolic of adaptability, worldliness and patriotism.  It describes the children of a parent serving full-time in the armed forces, and can also refer to the unique subculture and lifestyle of both current and former children of Military families.  Most take military brat as a title that entails hardships including (but definitely not limited to) moving around the nation or world, leaving behind friends, changing schools, enduring deployments and coping with the absence of parents.

Like many of our military traditions, 'BRAT' came from the British Army.  When a member of the British Army was assigned abroad and could take his family (mostly in India), the family went with the member in an Admin status entitled:  BRAT status.  It is an acronym that stands for:  British Regiment Attached Traveler.  Over the years, it was altered to refer only to the children of the military member.  And the term not only stuck, but in many cases was adopted world-wide. 

We can?t emphasize enough the importance the support role our families play in our military.  The success of the military is dependent upon the safety and support of their family members.",2013-06-06T18:39:30+0000,477635188978677_71460148,355931204482410,1

Thank you for your consideration, but I am completely happy to be called an Army Brat. It's true that we wear the term with pride. I am proud to be a part of the Military, Army, and Ft Gordon. Thank you all for your invaluable support. I look forward to meeting some of you at the library on post or at the PX the 14-16. Thank you again!

5142,355931204482410_457327597676103,"Environmentally-Friendly Alternatives
There are many alternatives to balloon releases. Instead of littering the planet by letting balloons go, you can instead have fun, celebrate, and remember with environmentally friendly alternatives.
Let your imagination soar and who knows what creative, one-of-a-kind idea you might come up with!

Here are some ideas to get you started?

Plant in remembrance- A great way to honor and remember a loved one or an important issue is to bring more life to our planet. By planting a native tree, flower garden or butterfly garden you are not only giving life to that plant you are also providing shelter, resources, and clean air to all kinds of wildlife and people. This remembrance will last a very long time and you can visit your tree or flower bed as much as you want and create more life by doing so! Flowers and trees can also be used at fundraising events as incentives to donate. They could then be planted in a public area, perhaps taking on different shapes or words, or can be taken home by participants to be planted elsewhere as a living memory. Here?s a great place to find trees: www.GiveTreeGifts.com Another great idea: http://createyourforest.ca/ If you enter the coupon code GTGCYF10 during the checkout process you will save 10% on your order.

Flags, banners, and streamers- Many businesses are realizing the benefits of using reusable eye-catching signage. Colorful streamers, flags and banners save money and time over balloons, ribbons and helium. They are also weather resistant, save Helium, and can be reused again and again! Here are some great companies:  www.ribbonstreamers.com, www.custommadeflags.com, www.fortmyersbanners.com

Ribbon dancers- Instead of giving kids and guests balloons at parties or events why not give them something a little more engaging. Balloons will simply sit tied up or be gone in a flash if released (not to mention harm wildlife and deplete helium resources). Ribbon dancers are beautiful and require people to move around and have fun! A group of people spinning and twirling with a colorful long ribbon following their every move is surely a site to see. You can even have guests make their own ribbon dancer, decorations and all! Here is a great shop to get started.

Kites & garden spinners- Vibrant fabric that dance in the high winds or eye-catching colors spinning in the garden. Unlike balloons, kites and spinners can be enjoyed for years. Here?s an awesome place to find both, and more: www.zephyrkites.com Kites can be a great prize to give people who donate and can then be flown to draw attention. Here is an example of a successful group that uses kites for fundraising: www.exeterhospital.com

Drumming- The drum has been called the heartbeat of Mother Earth. Using drums to celebrate does not create waste or cause danger to wildlife.

Floating flowers or flower petals down a calm stream can give you the same sense of letting go.

You'll simply swipe your ID card, and when the guard verifies the information displayed by the system, you'll be able to enter. No PIN required. 2) When directed by the command due to extraordinary circumstances (such as a change in the installation's force protection posture), the gates CAN require a PIN number to be entered in addition to swiping the card. This is why you create a PIN number during registration. We hope this clears things up, and we're sorry for the confusion.",2013-01-08T20:40:24+0000,412855945456602_71017362,355931204482410,2
