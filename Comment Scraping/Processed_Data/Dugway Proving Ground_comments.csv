Last year there were 88 runners, so the event is steadily growing from its 2013 beginning with 35 runners. New this year was changing the direction of the course, along the same route but now the slopes that led down in previous years now had to be scaled. Most runners said that the new direction was tougher, but they still liked the course. The Dugway Trail and Ultra Run is the one day of the year when this secured post is open to the public, to run.

29,208564685839038_1405600409468787,"For the third year manufacturers, users and developers of instruments that defend against chemical and biological agents gave their systems a realistic workout unavailable elsewhere in the world. Aug. 15-27, S/K Challenge III pushed the limits of detectors and software from around the world, exposing them to simulated chemical and biological agents in realistic settings. No actual agent was used.                                                                                              The challenge reveals the strengths and weaknesses of current or developing detection systems, indicating which technologies should be pursued or abandoned.                                                                   Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom tested detection systems. Finland, France and Israel sent observers. Various U.S. government offices and industries tested systems or sent observers. S/K Challenge IV will be Aug. 7-18, 2017.                                                   Joseph L.
