Not many Soldiers are creating a calendar one year out and programing their appointments; and their leaders aren't involved in the process.  2- unit support.  Unit's, who are people, still believe soldiers are trying to take off during the last 3-6 months of their career.  Planning a year out resolves this.   3- the days of taking the last 3-6 months off are a thing of the past.  And, waiting to the last minute blaming training, unit won't let me, etc... is not an answer.  Leaders must be involved in the process, support those appointments, and ensure their soldiers not only schedule those appointments, but attend them.  We, unfortunately, are not a force that can plan a year out.  And, the appointment system (especially medical) often is not flexible enough to support the aims of a soldier in transition.",2013-02-13T15:33:33+0000,546841495350527_102238690,10203995111104909,2
