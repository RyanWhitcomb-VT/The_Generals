137,192848048881_10154043216068882,"I think from a military-minded position, it would financially and security wise be a good move to place the DLI elsewhere in the country out of an area that's cost of living is so ridiculously high that all of lower enlisted cannot really even take advantage of many of the things being here is supposed to allow access too. And as a major tech school...that is the ranking of many of the service members here.   It costs the mil more money in BAH and many many other aspects to keep it open here, just 'for old times sake'.  When it is not the best situated or more effective location for training everyone, moving everything to a larger, less expensive, and more isolated (not a coastal easier soft target) would not be a bad thing.  Really they should have moved it when they closed Ord, it is only the major petitioning and lobbying by the city and state for fear of losing too much money (like I said this is a financial sink hole, so yeah they wouldn't want all that revenue to leave) that kept it here.  
To be able to live here, doesn't imply you can thrive here on the ever shrinking budget.  With extremely limited land space and historical buildings to watch out for, it is also very limited in its ability to expand or improve on it's own infrastructure and mission capability.  For a joint service installation, it is really just self-limiting.  That being said, I don't think they will ever really move it because too many big wigs and retirees like that it is in such a tourist hot-spot and so both reminiscing and self-placed importance of their memories and loss of access to nifty perks for them will stymie any moves to relocate.",2016-08-16T21:34:39+0000,10154043216068882_10154043700023882,10154422899440901,1

You'll get used to the various acronyms soon enough. The whole Army community is POM (Presidio of Monterey). But POM is also, specifically, the location of the Presidio, which is where DLI is (also known as DLIFLC or Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center). Also, on OMC is the DMDC (Defense Manpower Data Center) in the DOD Center. The DOD (Department of Defense) Center is the tall building on Gigling Road. It used to be a hospital in Fort Ord days. Also on Gigling Road, at the intersection with General Jim Moore Blvd, is the General Stilwell Community Center. Within the Stilwell Center is ACS (Army Community Service) and some FMWR (Family and Morale, Welfare & Recreation) offices. Hope those acronyms and locations make your transition here a little smoother. If you have kids, you'll want to check out the CYSS (Child, Youth & School Services), the CDC (Child Development Center, specifically the Monterey Road CDC) and PYC (Porter Youth Center).

2071,192848048881_282835878423762,"In response to your concern, our Police Department provided the following response assuring there were additional officers in the housing areas providing goodies to children:
Dear Ms. Grimes,
I am sorry to hear you didn?t have contact with our patrols on Halloween. However, we did have extra officers just for Halloween. They were in the housing areas passing out ?goodie bags? that were specially prepared for us by our OMC Mayor?s Program. Each of our Halloween roving patrols split the ?treats? and passed out glow bracelets in addition to the treats. We provided two officers at the ?Light In The Night? celebration at the Post Chapel, and they were also handed out glow bracelets and other goodies. This was all in addition to our regular patrols normally scheduled for a Monday nights shift. POM PD had six officers on overtime especially for the kids. 
I personally talked to the officers hired on that night, and they had a wonderful time interacting with the kids and passing out goodies. Again, I?m sorry you and your kids missed out, but we definitely were out there to make the Presidio of Monterey and La Mesa Family Housing areas a fun and safe place to celebrate Halloween. And I am also sorry we missed you because, as you?ll probably agree, it?s all about the kids. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to address your concerns.",2011-11-08T20:41:55+0000,282835878423762_4042672,192848048881,0

2396,192848048881_157015420976064,"The response from our professionals: There are many Soldiers still serving honorably today who have sought professional help for suicidal thoughts and feelings. Open communication and honesty not only saved their lives but likely saved their military careers as well. Any Soldier in the U.S. Army who is having thoughts or feelings of suicide is encouraged to talk to their chain of command, a medical or behavioral-health professional, or even a trusted friend or family member. Suicidal feelings are nothing to be ashamed of, and one should not let fear of punishment or disapproval prevent them from seeking help. Talking these feelings over with someone who cares is one of the most important things a suicidal person can do. 
As for the question ""Can a person enlist in the Army with if he/she has a history of suicidal thoughts or feelings,"" that would best be answered by an Army recruiter.

One recurring theme is our cable, internet and phone service providers are NOT providing the quality of service most of you are accustomed to.  Our partners at Clark Pinnacle are working to get other servce providers to come in to provide these services to our communities while not allowing them to ""cherry pick"" where they would offer service.  What this means is we have to get them to commit to upgrading infrastructure throughout rather than coming into only, say Doe Park and providing service there where the project already has the backbone and they could start collecting user fees with very minimal investment.  Complicating the issue are contractual agreements the Army had in place prior to us going the privatized housing initiative.

2520,192848048881_304089662456,I always had a love affair with targets and Biology. I now own two rifles (Ruger American Rimfire 8306 and Henry Golden Boy). I have a Masters in Medical Biology. I work for a local health department and intend to be an Instructor at a local college when I retire at 67. I am now 64 and a 3 year breast cancer survivor. This has taught me that life is short and you must pursue what YOU like. I drove past the local firing range that had been there for decades one too many times. An Internet search revealed a local NRA Women On Target class and I took it and loved it. I am now an NRA member and taking the 14 hour NRA Basic Rifle course to start on 7/27/15 and am a range member. I am reading NRAs basic rifle course book and noted that you are the sole female contributor and Googled you to find an extraordinary human being! Thank you for serving as inspiration to young and older women alike!,2015-07-11T12:41:02+0000,304089662456_10153417919652457,1711649485790880,0
