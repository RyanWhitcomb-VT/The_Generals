Miss America turns 240 years old today
and she doesn't look a day over 229.
The World likes to say she acts cray-cray...
But me? I think she's doing just fine!
There's 3.2 million voices that want to be heard
and each one has something to say.
Remember when this desire first was stirred?
Our forefathers gathered together to pray.
They decided to give us many freedoms galore;
Rights to Pray, Assemble, Defend, Express and Speak.
The Tired were welcome, as well as the Poor.
And we didn't turn away the Meek.
All of these people have feelings that yearn.
And, you see, some of us must learn
to allow others to have a turn 
at letting their light burn.
Through the years, there have been wars...
North vs. South
Blacks vs. Whites
Men vs. Women
Gays vs. Straights
Christians vs. Muslims
And there have been many, many more.
But tell me, what are we fighting for?
Why do we attack each other at the core?
The US Military defends our Freedom every day.
But when we, as Americans, make each other pay,
we take all that Freedom away!
Which is why the World says we've gone astray.
Remember Lady Liberty's mighty recipe?
It was the great American Melting Pot.
Do you throw out all the gingers, because you don't like (red-headed) me?
(Smile) Well I certainly hope not!
But seriously...
America IS ready for a change.
Independence and progress were how this nation was born.
This concept is NOT really strange.
Then why are so many citizens torn and forlorn?
Because humans are imperfect; we are all sinners.
Evil does exist and it is all around us.
But I believe that most Americans are winners
and come together to disarm the evil, we must!
I'm expressing my autonomy and proudly make this claim...
While others may say our Country is unjust,
I will continue to pray for us in Jesus' name,
since our motto has been, and still is, ""In God We Trust!""",2016-07-04T19:34:40+0000,10154318057921060_10154318800121060,10153469429509232,0

Zombie volunteers are asked to bring or wear their own costumes as a small supply of Zombie wear will available at the event. You can also choose to come in your undead makeup or be made up by ""Zombie Makers"" on October 31, 2014 between 5 - 6:20 am at Magrath Sports Complex. Once you have been transformed into a Zombie you will be positioned throughout the course starting around 6:30 am.

As runners come by, Zombies will try to take the runners flags. If the runner looses all of their flags the Zombie transformation will occur AFTER crossing the finish line (the virus needs time to take effect after infection).

Qualifications: Zombie volunteers must be 18 years and older, call BOSS at 772-7807 to register, and provide their own Zombie clothing.

Training: There will be a rehearsal at 2 pm on October 30 at Magrath Sports Complex track - Zombies are welcome to attend or you can just watch a few of the many Zombie movies available and practice your foot drag prior to the event.

Time Line: 5 am - Arrive at Magrath Sports Complex to be transformed into a Zombie, 6:30 am - Be positioned throughout the course, 7 am - first wave of runners leave starting gate, 8 pm - second wave of runners leave starting gate, 9 am - third and last wave of runners leave starting gate, 10 am - run complete - help clean up your Zombie areas.

There were even people ththat bought tickets for riverfest but had to pay to ride the boat for the tour because they were no longer doing the boat tour for riverfest  it would just be helpful for people to maybe be told when you buy the ticket the last boat times.

1891,120470921059_10151932542771060,"Alright, I also paid my $5 to see the images, so here's my additional 2 cents:

(1) The set of pictures posted above with the text ""see some photos at"" are not exactly representative of what's in the album you pay for.

(2) MWR photos that are up so far are only from in front of the green screen and from the start/finish line. I don't know if there's more they haven't uploaded.

(3) Yes, you have to pay $5 just to look at them. I thought - ""Cool, $5 and I can download all the ones I'm in that I like."" But can't download or print any and there's no option to buy prints, either. 

(4) Honestly, you probably wouldn't want to buy any. As of now, there's maybe a handful of really nice pictures, then there's about 20% of pictures that would be nice if they had post-editing (crop, rotate, adjust), and then there's the other 75% that are just blurry, out of focus, badly framed. Lots of blurry pictures of peoples' butts going across the finish line.

Having paid my $5, my recommendation would be that other people save their money. At least until all pictures have been uploaded (I expect there would be some from the actual course? Maybe?) and report back on whether any of those are worth paying for.",2013-09-14T04:28:54+0000,10151932542771060_30296714,872977419384923,0
1892,120470921059_10151932542771060,If you buy the album you cannot download them afterwards and some are sideways with no way to rotate them.

Currently, Camaraderie of Courage (a not for profit organization supporting 1BCT soldiers) is sponsoring the program to support 1BCT troops and their mission by providing basic school supplies to children in their area of operation.  
Those involved in this project consider education a value to all children of all nationalities. 
Operation Education is funded solely by individuals and private donators who share the value of this program. Absolutely NO military funding is being used for this project therefore nothing is being taken away from any DOD program or military child. 
We receive wonderful feedback from our deployed troops regarding Operation Education. We have received several photos of the troops distributing school supplies and it is difficult to tell who is more elated, the children receiving the school supplies or the soldiers giving them. To view these photographs or learn more please visit www.camaraderieofcourage.org.
A crucial componant of the mission of 1BCT soldiers is to assist in building schools in the Afghan region. And we are proud to assist with this mission in any way we can. Education is a vital part of building and shaping the future of Afghanistan. And Operation Education is proud to be a part of that. 
On a separate note Camaraderie of Courage/Operation Education would like to thank Fort Drum FMWR for posting our event information.

As a patron and family member of Pine Plains Gym and Fort Drum for over a decade, these were vital services that supported the family members that are being taken away!! To see the trickle affect of the health and mental rewards for family members to be able to workout AND gain connections with others to vent their issues, problems, struggles and gain knowledge from others of the services that Fort Drum has and experiences with us veterans of the area is amazing.  Now that there will be a $3.50 cost impossed per hour per child ( but not offer for that cost diapering/toiletting or feeding services??) this wonderful outlet will simply slip away.  Many can not afford these costs to stay fit both physically and mentally and we as a community will revert back to the isolated, depressed, unhealthy days of Fort Drum.
