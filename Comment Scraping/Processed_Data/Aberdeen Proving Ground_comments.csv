Flushing operations may also lead to discolored water, which can be drawn into homes if the water is being used during or immediately following the flushing. Such events should affect customers for a few hours at most. The discoloration is caused by iron (red color) or manganese (black color) particles being dislodged from the water main which can stain porcelain and laundry. If discoloration occurs, open the cold tap nearest the water meter to full flow until the water runs clear. In some situations this may take 5 to 10 minutes. It is also advised that you make sure your water is clear before doing laundry or other projects for which discolored water could cause problems.",2016-02-15T23:52:19+0000,10153638784511284_10153652443226284,238070186283,0

781,238070186283_10153640880916284,"So let's break this down for those who seem to either be new to government service or never figured it out:

First off, this site is run by the public affairs office which falls under the Garrison.  Their job is to report information and vet what is clear for public disclosure and they make no decisions to installation closures at all.  Therefore, complaining here is just openly complaining and they are doing their jobs by editing and removing those things that they do not feel should be on here... Now let's break down why.

Post closure determination are also not made by their immediate commander in the Garrison either, they are made by the installation commander... who happens to be a Commanding General of the largest Organization on this post.   As such they are probably doing a lot of people a favor by removing negative and nasty comments that are based on personal ignorance... and why do I say personal ignorance, well here comes the key... pay attention now:

This installation has somewhere near 20k people on it and a LOT of money is lost when it closes and no work occurs.  This is the military and the closure is based on very specific things, none of which are where people chose to live.  We are all adults and trusted that we can make decisions based on our own safety.  

Post closes when conditions on post make it unsafe to be on post or normal business can not occur.  This include being unable to clear parking lots, keep up with maintenance or something of that nature.  This generally also translates to the same issues around where people live but is completely exclusive in the decision. 

In the case post is clear and business is able to operate, yet they know a lot of surrounding areas are still hazardous (and this is the important part) they post that Unscheduled Leave is authorized, leaving the decision to you as an adult.   So be an adult and save a couple days of leave if you live in an area that you know could be hazardous when post is not.   A failure to do so is your failure and no one else.  

I like days off just like the rest of everyone else, but to cry about conditions where you are coming from just makes you look uninformed.    Hope everyone enjoys their day, no matter what personal decision they have made.  And thank you PAO for posting timely information as you have it.  Anyone with a legitimate complaint or concern would be welcomed to submit it to the commander via their organizational chain of command as well I am sure.... that is how true issues are handled.",2016-02-10T12:37:25+0000,10153640880916284_10153642148456284,10205240894852437,14

You may be able talk crazy on your personal FB, Twitter, or other online forums, but doing it on an official government social media site, whether you're a Soldier (which I doubt is the case), DA Civilian, or contractor, you may be held liable for your comments or actions. ALARACT 122/2015, which comes as part of an effort to address Soldier use of social media and other online forms of communication, also defines good behavior online, ""electronic communication,"" and ""online-related incident."" The ALARACT emphasizes commanders' responsibility to ""reinforce a climate where current and future members of the Army team, including Soldiers, Army civilians, contractors, and Family members, understand that online misconduct is inconsistent with Army values."" In a separate article, Government civilians are also subject to punishment for certain posts on social media, even when they're off duty, according to Eura Cherry, attorney at the Fort Belvoir Office of the Staff Judge Advocate.

""Employees should be aware that some of their off duty conduct may be deemed misconduct that is punishable by their employer,"" Cherry said. ""They should be mindful when utilizing social media and making posts which could be interpreted as defamatory, libelous, obscene, abusive, threatening, racially or ethnically hateful or otherwise offense or illegal.""

843,238070186283_10153611539036284,"From the Harford county Facebook feed:  SNOW UPDATE: As of 11 p.m. Monday night, we cleared at least one lane of road on 87% of Harford County?s 1,000 miles of roads. Due to the limited space to put snow and the number of driveways, the County?s 1,200 cul-de-sacs and the townhouse roads remain challenging and frequently require the use of a front end loader. Fortunately, yesterday we were able to procure an additional 17 of them (25 total) from local contractors and have dedicated most of them to those challenging areas to make much better progress. Crews have been on the road attacking the snow throughout the night. We are striving to reach all of the roads with at least one pass of the snow plow by early Tuesday afternoon.
Please note that the county does not plow private roads marked by blue signs.
TUESDAY DRIVING: Even some plowed roads are narrow with historic levels of snow piled on either side, which limits visibility, especially at intersections. .Please stay off the roads again today if possible to allow our plows to work and to give priority to emergency vehicles. Please do not park in the street.
Please know that our Highways crews have worked incredibly hard and have not been home since they started fighting this historic snowfall event last Friday evening. Please bear with them as these dedicated employees continue to help the residents of the County dig out.

923,238070186283_10153607586056284,"I understand completely the rationale behind waiting until tomorrow morning to make a decision concerning whether or not the post will be open on Monday.  However, the questions about the HM-CBRNE course highlight the fact that in some cases, a decision made well in advance would help those who are, for example, flying into the area to make better plans.  Also, in my particular situation, I cleared my driveway and sidewalk yesterday, but the street outside my house is still impassable.  It seems that a decision whether or not to open post should depend upon not only what can be cleared on post but also upon whether or not people can actually get to the post in the first place.  With regard to the question about the course, the policy right now is that if the post is open, the buses will [attempt to] pick up students from the designated hotels.  If the post is not open Monday, the course will not be held that day.  What Ms. Boehm meant was that all of the CME originally promised for the full five-day course will still be given (we'll talk fast and fit everything in during the rest of the week!).",2016-01-24T18:57:27+0000,10153607586056284_10153609556391284,10152045513937934,0

I remember seeing this happen on every single base we lived on as a kid. With time being away from the military life during college years then coming back I was confused about if it was the same.  I am guilty of not stopping but I didn't know because I've never seen anyone stop on this base and I don't recall if it was done in Germany I didn't really drive during those hours. This is only our second duty station, lol! When I observed my hubby do flag duty I simply turn off my car and sat quietly, but the second time I got out my car and stood at attention (I didn't know which was right, lol)!  If we are outside when the bugle call comes we do accordingly but I've wondered about it while driving but never really asked the question. Don't judge me for walking in confusion so long when I could have simply asked!  I never think about it until it happens but most of the time I'm not out and about around that time.

2799,238070186283_10152671000036284,"I think the policy is generous in allowing civilians to simply stop their vehicles and remain inside. That never used to be an option. I applaud the return of the practice. If nothing else it reminds everyone of where they work and what team they are on. Also giving people a week to get used to the idea is nice, although some will still be caught by surprise, visitors in particular. As an Army brat and having worked on another installation where this was observed the practice also brings back fond memories. I look forward to it, and enjoyed the practice bugle calls a few days ago.

BTW, the Army posts all the bugle calls, sheet music and free mp3 downloads at

2805,238070186283_10152670727131284,"Did you know a Native American Commander in the USN in World War II initiated and lead an attack on a far superior Japanese fleet sent to attack the Leyte landing?

He was CDR Ernest E Evans, MoH recipient, half Cherokee and quarter Creek Indian, skipper of the  USS Johnston.

On the first attack the superstructure of the Johnston, the clothing and one hand of Evans were blown away. On the second attack, Evans steered the ship naked standing at the stern shouting directions through an open hatch to sailors manually steering the ship below. On the third attack, the Johnston was sunk, but a Japanese ship sailed past the debris with their crew lining the rail and saluting the Johnston and crew. 

Evans would have been justified in withdrawing after his first attack, but he continued instead.

Other ships, their crews, and aircraft of the U.S. acted heroically as well in the battle, but CDR Evans and the USS Johnston lead the way. The Leyte landing was saved, thousands of soldiers and Marines were saved, and this marked the last and largest significant naval battle of the war for the Japanese. Evans body was never found, and a headstone marks his empty grave in the Philippines. This was David and Goliath battle with no reasonable outlook for David. But the Japanese assumed from the ferocity of the attack that Halsey's fleet must be nearby, not decoyed away by another Japanese fleet. So they withdrew. 

Read about CDR Evans

And read about the Battle off Samar. 

         Any coward can fight a battle when he's sure of winning;
         but give me the man who has pluck to fight when he's sure of
         losing.
         That's my way, sir; and there are many victories worse than a
         defeat.

At this time there are no plans to

change traffic patterns on the installation; all installation personnel,

including residents must be considered when making traffic flow

recommendations.  While traffic has slowed on Route 22/Gate it still allows

for the same amount of traffic through-put per hour and Route 24/Gate has

not reached maximum through-put capacity; there are no plans to open any

other gates on the installation.

2886,238070186283_10152532355851284,Any thoughts of re-purposing local roads to help traffic avoid the construction? Could Gadsden and/or Rodman be used to get traffic off of Harford and onto Aberdeen Blvd earlier. perhaps making those two roads one-way in-bound in the morning and one-way out-bound in the afternoon? Could the middle Aberdeen Blvd gate be opened morning/afternoon through the construction period?

2958,238070186283_10152436227031284,This is a hoot.    Try driving down Aberdeen BLD and turning left on Md BLVD at around 4:30 in the afternoon.  Guaranteed to take 20-30 minutes to get off of post.

Traffic lights on Aberdeen and Maryland Blvd immediately turn red if any traffic is coming from the BRAC area.   I think if someone from Bld 6000  is walking across the parking lot jiggling their keys that the lights change to allow them to pass without hitting a red light.     The problem on MD and Aberdeen Blvds is that the green lights are too short and traffic is pouring in from the side roads.,2014-07-23T17:34:45+0000,10152436227031284_10152436711146284,10202855329917867,1
2962,238070186283_10152436227031284,I have to disagree with this survey. I have waited from Maryland Blvd to get out the gate for 30 minutes and that's with no traffic accidents.

2964,238070186283_10152436227031284,It would be interesting to have this testing conducted in the early Fall when APG is back into full operations.  I typically don't leave during the core departure hours - but if I do leave 'early' I am a bit surprised by the delay in time.  It would also be interesting to look at the times it takes to get to Rt 95 from the Rt 22 and Rt715 gate.  I see the adjustments that are being made and I don't believe they are going to fully address the bottleneck we experience.  I am not going to point all the blame at APG - I am very disappointed in the state / county in addressing this issue.  For those of us that have traveled to other Army installations - lets look at Redstone.  Redstone and the State of Alabama have engineered the 'red carpet' of easy transportation entry and exit from their facilities.   We have Rt 95 and a perfect route - Rt 715 that could be connected and say .. Yes congress/DoD - we have an easy access route and welcome future  consolidation efforts (just having Rt 22 through a busy town is not enough).,2014-07-25T12:38:19+0000,10152436227031284_10152439888361284,10153211595139224,0
2965,238070186283_10152436227031284,The problem with this study is it started when almost off post. The majority of the work force works well away from this intersection and faces more lights and traffic. And did they start from the green light at these intersections and were going or did they start at a red light. I can get from my area to 715 gate in 10-12 minutes no traffic no lights with speed limits followed. That time increases to 15 minutes when leaving post lights depending at 4 and goes to at least 20 minutes at 430.

Likewise, returning home from work isn?t too risky.   However, in the morning, going to work its 300 times more likely that you will be hurt.

I have been frustrated for years by the regulation that says if we use our leave to leave early for our own personal safety, then they still charge our personal leave when they close post.  But if, and only if, we stick it out and wait for the chain of command to close post - well then we get free time off charged to admin leave.  It isn't fair.  And it's a judgment call often made when based on how much leave time is saved.  Some of us don't have a lot of leave time.  Our safety should be most important and everyone should be given the same type of leave when post is closed.  And just because in years past they didn't close post is an absurd argument for saying no one should complain today.  We often don't get this much snow.

Harford County is monitoring another storm system that could impact Harford County during the morning rush hour Tuesday. At this time, the NWS is predicting at least 3 to 6 inches of snow for Harford County and the snow should start between 6 and 9 AM. At times, we could expect snow to fall more than 1 inch per hour, making driving conditions hazardous. Behind this storm will be very cold arctic air which will be felt for the remainder of the week. The EOC (Emergency Operations Center) will be activated to monitor the situation. Thanks, and be safe.",2013-12-09T23:24:32+0000,10151916544131284_29706494,976612799070479,0

STATE POLICE URGE CAUTION WITH PENDING SNOW STORM
(PIKESVILLE, MD) -- Maryland State Police along with the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, State Highway Administration and other local agencies are urging motorists to use caution if they have to travel during the pending snow storm. 

Colonel Marcus L. Brown, Superintendent of the Maryland State Police has directed barrack commanders across the state to be prepared to survey road conditions in their areas and deploy personnel as needed. Colonel Brown also urges motorists to be cautious when traveling due to the possible hazardous conditions that may arise from the pending snow event. 

During snow storms, abandoned and disabled vehicles cause a major problem for snow removal equipment and for troopers responding to emergency situations. Troopers encourage those who do not need to travel during the storm to stay off the roads. 

If motorists find it necessary to travel during this event, they are reminded of the highway restrictions should a snow emergency plan go into effect. Once in effect, parking is prohibited on any street or road designated as a snow emergency route. All vehicles are required to have approved mud and snow tires or chains while operating during a declared snow emergency. All abandoned or unattended vehicles will be towed from major roadways. 

In the event of power failure, traffic lights may not function properly. In that case, the law requires all drivers approaching an intersection with a non functioning traffic light to stop. Drivers may proceed only after they have yielded to any vehicles or pedestrians already in the intersection. They must remain stopped until the intersection is clear and safe to proceed. 

For the latest statewide emergency information, citizens are urged to visit the Maryland Emergency Management Agency website at www.mema.state.md.us. Up to the minute statewide traffic information, including road closures due to snow or ice is available on-line at www.511md.org, or by calling 511. Road conditions and views of live traffic cameras are also available on the State Highway Administration website at www.roads.maryland.gov. 

Citizens are advised not to call Maryland State Police barracks simply to check on road conditions. Calls to police or 911 centers during the storm should be for emergency situations only. 

Maryland State Police will be working closely with State Highway Administration and Maryland Emergency Management Agency officials throughout the storm. Marylanders are urged not to travel during the storm unless absolutely necessary.

The speakers need to be on each street possibly on both ends of the street or speakers built on the outside of our houses because we cannot here from the inside because we have our daily house activities going on and when we go outside it is muffled and hard to hear.  Please contact me by Private Message and I will help with this situation.  Many of my neighbors can never hear and I had to go tell them when we had the last Tornado Watch announcement, which I barely heard.  The system needs to be modernized for families today.  It needs to be fixed, so we can know if we need to take cover or if we are under any attacks.  I am a Veteran and we do live on a military base, which makes us more vulnerable.

They are allowed on road surfaces posted at 50mph or lower and on the shoulder of a high speed roadway.  Roadways prohibited to bicyclists (and pedestrians) are posted with signage.  Since the major thoroughfares on base are divided, each direction of travel is considered as a one-way road.  As such, bicyclists may use either side of the road (left or right).  

Motor vehicles passing bicyclists must pass with care, observing 3 feet of separation when practicable, otherwise due care must be taken when passing a cyclist any closer.   It is prohibited to interfere with a bicyclists progress, as well as throwing objects at a cyclist or intentionally opening a car door while a bicyclist is passing.

As it turned out the weather was not a significant factor for many in Harford County to get to APG *and* to get home again. Nor even for others in the DC area where OPM decided to close.

But the forecasts indicated it would be unsafe even during the early part of the day, and almost uniformly governments, schools, and courts in the area held the opinion that the risk of this outcome was too much to bear.

This choice by APG makes it seem an outlier in its concern for the welfare and safety of its workers. And in light of the three recent deaths at APG, it is not an image APG should want to foster.",2013-03-07T15:47:01+0000,10151355529656284_26136272,810860102259556,0

4782,238070186283_10151136516141284,"In the event that APG residents have to evacuate their home due to an emergency, they should bring their pet(s) in a kennel to one of the available shelters. These shelters are available to residents who have been significantly affected and cannot remain in their homes. Normally, conditions of this nature include life safety, uninhabitable structure or other significant factors. Residents who lose power on post should not evacuate their homes, as loss of power alone is not considered an emergency condition. Shelter resources are limited and reserved for emergency evacuees. 

Shelter locations are:

For at least the next two weekends, the Maryland 715 Gate will close from Friday at 6 p.m. until Sunday at 6 p.m.  The Route 22 gate will be open from Friday at 6 p.m. until Sunday at 6:30 to accommodate traffic on and off post.  This is so the Directorate of Public Works can continue unexploded ordnance (USO) survey at the Maryland Pond opposite Ruggles Golf Course.  Motorists will be rerouted to the Route 22 gate during these times only.  Additionally, the visitor center and inspection lane will be relocated to the Route 22 gate.
In addition, the Aberdeen Boulevard gate (MD Route 132) will be closed to incoming traffic effective Monday, Oct. 22.  The gate will remain open to outgoing traffic on weekdays only from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m.  
Please note  that the openings and closings for the Maryland 715 and Route 22 Gates are temporary.  Once the UXO survey is complete, normal gate operations will resume.

5094,238070186283_10150814822891284,Jessica-the ramp closure mentioned above is only for this coming weekend. But you are correct in reading that there is a major road construction project in progress that will affect access to APG at the MD715/40 interchange. A one-year MD 715 southbound ramp closure will occur towards end of May. You can read more about the scope of the project and lane closures in a past issue of the APG News (www.apgnews.apg.army.mil) under Archives (9 Feb 2012). We will continue to publicize all updates as we have them. -tk,2012-05-09T17:45:16+0000,10150814822891284_22582794,238070186283,0

5181,238070186283_10150351273186284,"THANKSGIVING: Normally the high costs of serving the Thanksgiving meal is recouped over the several months following Thanksgiving. However because the dining facility is closing Dec. 10, there is no way to recover the costs--several thousands of dollars. WHY THE DFAC IS CLOSING: The DFAC is closing due to the decreased number of Soldiers on APG after the Base Realignment and Closure. The operation of a military DFAC is governed by military regulation and based on Soldier population. Currently, there are less than 80 APG Soldiers who receive meal pay, or Basic Allowance for Subsistence. EATING OPTIONS: The installation does, however, offer the following eating options?the shoppette Subways,  commissary deli, Burger King (set to open in November), Tim Horton's snack bar and coffee/pastry cart (C4ISR), ARGO mobile food service located throughout post, bowling alley grill, Donna?s Pit Beef at the post theater, Sutherland Grill at Ruggles golf course cub house, Southside Grill in the APG South recreation center, Northside Grill in the APG North recreation center, ISG BBQ in the parking lot of Chesapeake Challenge, Top of the Bay (set to open Nov. 21), Anthony's Pizza  (PX Food Court) and the CUP building on APG South.
