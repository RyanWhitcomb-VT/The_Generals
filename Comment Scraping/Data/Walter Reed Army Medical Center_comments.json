Ever year a post on facebook goes Viral with wrong information about sending \"Recovering Soldiers\" Christmas cards with Walter Reeds old D.C address. Walter Reed shut down in D.C in 2011 and opened up in Bethesda Maryland. But As far as sending direct mail to Walter Reed you can't because a policy (Transportation Policy) was made by the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense in 2001. To protect soldiers and medical staff. You can go through local Red Cross office, Military Treatment Facility or VA Hospital to obtain the local guidelines for sending cards. They all go through the cards to make sure they are safe to be delivered. But the deadline for the Red Cross has passed so you take your cards to your Local VA Hospital. https://www.facebook.com/Walter-Reed-National-Military-Medical-Center-295857217111107/?fref=ts&hc_location=ufi", "Comment_ID": "10153481003453533_10153481042983533", "Commenter_ID": "1131504596876132", "Post_ID": "94176393532_10153481003453533", "Likes": 5, "Created_Time": "2015-12-18T21:07:10+0000"}, {"Comment": "Should have been fixed the address al long time ago", "Comment_ID": "10153481003453533_10153481051908533", "Commenter_ID": "10202726553097767", "Post_ID": "94176393532_10153481003453533", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2015-12-18T21:14:27+0000"}, {"Comment": "I whish this had been posted three months ago.

I have been inside Walter Reed several times a week for the past three years, and can assure you that it was NOT in disrepair, no walls were falling down, and the care they receive there has never wavered.

If answers given by the doctors and nurses providing care are not satisfactory, we have a patient advocacy office and an inspector general available to all patients. Military patients have ombudsmen available to them for help on any issue.  \n\nIf the other support channels are not meeting our patients or their families\u2019 needs, my door is always open. If there are issues, we want to know about them so we can make it right and prevent them from occurring in the future.\n\nMilitary patients assigned or attached to the Warrior Transition Brigade have a squad leader assigned to provide all kinds of support during sometimes lengthy periods of healing and rehabilitation.  These wounded, ill or injured warriors also have a nurse case manager assigned to coordinate all the various types of specialty medical care they may need, and a primary care manager - a physician assigned to them for all primary care needs. Each warrior has a care plan tailored to his or her individual medical needs.\n\nFamily members play an important role in the healing process. Family members initially arriving to meet a recently injured patient are supported by our Soldier Family Assistance Center with many types of help. Many family members become Non-Medical Attendants and reside with their wounded warrior at Walter Reed during recovery.\n\nThe whole purpose of the Warrior Transition Brigade is to help wounded, ill and injured warriors heal.  The brigade leadership, the social workers, physical and occupational therapists, chaplains, nurses and doctors are here to help them move forward in their transition back to duty or back to civilian life. -- Col.

Its delay of implementation has caused probably needless death and certainly a lot of other complications with much more suffering.\n\nAlso I agree the Iraqi's need to step up and take care of their own security.

To me the value of the training can be evaluated only by the level of true communication achieved, and whether that communication moves the individual to develop their own personal plan to meet the challenge.  First you have to overcome the amount of training they must endure having the effect of becoming so much, \"blah, blah, blah,\" and capture their attention.  I think this might be a way in which that can be done.  No one can really be prepared for the realities of war to the point that they are not profoundly impacted.  Having served as a nurse many years, I know something of all the stressors mentioned in this article.  When I use to coach little girls in girls softball I used the approach of asking them, what are you going to do when the ball comes to you?  I would tell them you must know that the ball is coming to you, and already know what you are going to do with it when it comes to you.  I think this type of training helps to focus the Soldier toward this thinking.  The only thing I would do would be to force the Soldier, through different role play etc, to write or state what resources they would utilize to face and overcome these stressors.  It is in having a plan, and a plan B, and a plan C, that \"successful\" deployment is achieved, especially in this area of stress.", "Comment_ID": "106460732725401_151680", "Commenter_ID": "862968703715978", "Post_ID": "94176393532_106460732725401", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2010-04-06T15:12:34+0000"}, {"Comment": "I attended this service in 1972,73.", "Comment_ID": "109675295729291_195587", "Commenter_ID": "1363751540324117", "Post_ID": "94176393532_109675295729291", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2010-04-03T01:17:38+0000"}, {"Comment": "What a wonderful program.....Thanks for all your work", "Comment_ID": "105653996140508_124723", "Commenter_ID": "10202752650429760", "Post_ID": "94176393532_105653996140508", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2010-04-02T15:17:47+0000"}, {"Comment": "thats wonderful.....", "Comment_ID": "105046902868956_111693", "Commenter_ID": "10203047922946992", "Post_ID": "94176393532_105046902868956", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2010-04-01T16:47:18+0000"}, {"Comment": "That is a great way to be ready for this terrible posibility!
