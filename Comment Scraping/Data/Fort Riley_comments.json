BUT this leader also supervises several politically impressionable, young Joes who respect their leaders opinion. These young Joes (with no prior political officiation) friend their leader on social media and are unduly influenced by these posts to vote for a certain candidate. OR, worse a leader directly influences a subordinate to vote a certain way by discussing only their candidates politics at the workplace. \nAs difficult as it is to understand to a person without military experience. The military really doesn't want a bunch of drones that don't think for themselves and only follow orders. They want smart, educated, disciplined, people, who can research, problem solve, and come to their own conclusions effectively. The reason these social media, and political rules and regulations are in place is to protect every individuals right to choose who they want to vote for without influence from others. It allows everyone in the DoD the opportunity to maintain their OWN opinion, to research the candidates they want in office, and the ability to place their truest most unbiased vote. \nGranted, to the naked eye it appears DoD muffles freedom of speech as many before you have thought and said time and again. When observed closer, you'll realize it's only done to protect every individuals bigger right to an unbiased political vote which is one of the core foundations of a true democracy.", "Comment_ID": "10154385513271306_10154388394476306", "Commenter_ID": "10205218029149900", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10154385513271306", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2016-07-29T18:28:27+0000"}, {"Comment": "Elijah John Arenas interesting read", "Comment_ID": "10154385513271306_10154386420851306", "Commenter_ID": "10203702369507764", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10154385513271306", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2016-07-29T01:19:48+0000"}, {"Comment": "We have our winner!

General Boykin, a founding member of Delta Force and 36-year veteran, was eager to speak to Fort Riley's young soldiers about the importance of faith to the soldier. This week, following an angry demand by atheist Mikey Weinstein, which actively stalks General Boykin in his stand for military religious freedom, Fort Riley officials promptly canceled the prayer breakfast, citing \"scheduling conflicts.\" Not only would the event be \"rescheduled,\" but the official said General Boykin would not be invited back as a speaker. The message is clear: the men and women in uniform at Fort Riley will not be permitted to hear from one of the Army's own highly decorated heroes because he is unapologetic about his Christian faith. When military officials are so frightened by anti-Christian activists that they deny Christian soldiers the opportunity to hear from a man who has seen his faith at work in his distinguished career, how do we expect them to respond to the real threats that are facing America today?  I would like to remind all that, by definition, atheist's have no religion and do not believe in religion or a supreme being.  Therefore, they are not protected by the constitution in terms of religion.  Why then are they permitted to dictate policy to those that are?

In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of man and citizens\".\n\nJohn Adams, Signer of the Declaration of Independence and Second President of the United States:\n\"It is religion and morality alone which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand. The only foundation of a free constitution is pure virtue\".\n\n\"We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. . . . Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other\".\n\nWilliam Penn, Founder of Pennsylvania:\n\"It is impossible that any people of government should ever prosper, where men render not unto God, that which is God's, as well as to Caesar, that which is Caesar's\".\n\nJames McHenry, Signer of the Constitution, Secretary of War, namesake of Fort McHenry:\n\"Public utility pleads most forcibly for the general distribution of the Holy Scriptures. The doctrine they preach, the obligations they impose, the punishment they threaten, the rewards they promise, the stamp and image of divinity they bear, which produces a conviction of their truths, can alone secure to society, order and peace, and to our courts of justice and constitutions of government, purity, stability and usefulness. In vain, without the Bible, we increase penal laws and draw entrenchments around our institutions. Bibles are strong entrenchments. Where they abound, men cannot pursue wicked courses, and at the same time enjoy quiet conscience.\n\nThomas Jefferson, US President, Signer of Declaration of Independence:\n\"The doctrines of Jesus are simple, and tend all to the happiness of mankind\".\n\nBenjamin Franklin, Signer of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence:\n\"Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters\".\n\n\"I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men\".\n\nFisher Ames, Framer of the First Amendment:\n\"Our liberty depends on our education, our laws, and habits . . . it is founded on morals and religion, whose authority reigns in the heart, and on the influence all these produce on public opinion before that opinion governs rulers\".\n\nJohn Quincy Adams, Sixth President of the United States:\n\"There are three points of doctrine the belief of which forms the foundation of all morality. The first is the existence of God; the second is the immortality of the human soul; and the third is a future state of rewards and punishments. Suppose it possible for a man to disbelieve either of these three articles of faith and that man will have no conscience, he will have no other law than that of the tiger or the shark. The laws of man may bind him in chains or may put him to death, but they never can make him wise, virtuous, or happy\".", "Comment_ID": "10154228022031306_10154232089476306", "Commenter_ID": "692269094152511", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10154228022031306", "Likes": 2, "Created_Time": "2016-06-03T16:01:19+0000"}, {"Comment": "You got it Bill A.

Sixteen of the 22 commissaries have sushi bars that would also be temporarily suspended. DeCA is looking at both long-term and interim solutions to offer the valued deli and bakery services. Using an expedited contracting process, DeCA expects to have a new contract in place by mid-May. \n\nAnd as an interim solution, to avoid disruption of services, the Agency is pursuing the use of temporary employees to ensure delivery of limited services until a new contractor can be brought on board.   \"Our goal is to offer our customers high-quality products and services in every aisle of the commissary,\" said Defense Commissary Agency Director and CEO Joseph H. Jeu. \"The difficult decision to not renew the contract option year with one of our current deli and bakery contractors was made in the best interest of our customers.\" If a break in deli and bakery services does occur, customers can purchase cold cuts, potato and macaroni salad, fruit and vegetable trays and similar items in their commissary grocery and produce aisles. Store management has increased product quantities and will bring in new items to help fill in any short-term void.  \"We apologize for the inconvenience to our customers,\" Jeu said. \"We're working to return our deli and bakery operations in these impacted stores to normal as quickly as possible.  \n\nCommissaries Impacted \n* Locations with sushi bars that would also be suspended.

Commissaries provide a military benefit and make no profit on the sale of merchandise.

By shopping regularly in the commissary, patrons save an average of 30 percent or more on their purchases compared to commercial prices \u2013 savings amounting to thousands of dollars annually. A core military family support element, and a valued part of military pay and benefits, commissaries contribute to family readiness, enhance the quality of life for America\u2019s military and their families, and help recruit and retain the best and brightest men and women to serve their country.

Today, there are 62 German and 11 Italian POWs interred at the cemetery. \n\nThe annual German and Italian Memorial Ceremony provides an opportunity to continue the international partnership born in war and continued in peace. It also honors former POWs and recognizes their contributions to the heritage of Fort Riley.\n\nMedia wishing to cover this event should contact Fort Riley USAG PAO to arrangement for an escort.

Other times, you can pick up a recommended list of items out put in a kit that you put together based on and tailored to your family members and needs.\n\nThere are many many already put together kits being sold on the internet.  Some of those kits I find not worthy of their very high prices.  \n\nI would either call or even better yet, go over to Fort Riley Emergency Management Office and see what they have their to help you.  You can also pay a visit to the Riley County Emergency Management located at 115 North 4th Street on the 2nd Floor.  \n\nhttp://www.rileycountyks.gov/207/Emergency-Management", "Comment_ID": "10152708873986306_10152709441281306", "Commenter_ID": "10205073484662332", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10152708873986306", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2014-09-30T19:35:01+0000"}, {"Comment": "is there a specific kit that can be purchased?

It is an orderly chain of command where all superior authority is obeyed and respected. Whinny soldiers  are not strong soldiers one could count on in a war zone. It is also not a fraternity,  a high school popularity contest , or a  college sorority...where in that would be the only road to promotion. If you are in the military you belong to them  ie GI. It is also important for leaders of any miliatry base to  realize a soldier that has been to war  and survived , is a soldeir  of the finest kind, to respect and use wisely by making sure he or she is teaching the new young soldiers how it all works and how to survive ina war zone. Being in the military is not about being politically correct via the wimpy society standards. It's about being a stronger  part of something greater than ones self and recognizing all the \"Heart Break Ridge\" Gunny's that know & understand what it's all about. Protect our military and our men & women of the military by letting strong leaders train them that truly know what they are doing and what is required. Those that have to be babied, need to be somewhere else. Hang on to those that truly know the realities of war or you will only have inexperienced  babies leading the charge in what ever war deployment they will face. It will not be pretty and history has given that lesson to the USA many times. Experience is the cornerstone to success for any military future to be strong...and for this nation to survive those that would destroy us or any western ideals.

I'm not an electrician, so i honestly have no idea how this could be prevented.

You probably don't remember me, sir, but you decided I wasn't good enough for your team on the first day you met me and then you kicked me out of the Army Frivilously.  I had no article 15s in my 5 year career, I had been to iraq and I was on my way to sniper school when I ran into you. The War had damaged my mind and I still had the mind of a child at the time and I was more or less completely unaware of how sick I was.  Even so, You treated me like hated slave.  You worked me from 5 am to 12 am and then I would have to drive home for a couple hours and then head back in.  You made the chaplain tell me that my wife was going to leave me and that I would never get hired anywhere, he also asked me how many times I masturbated per week.  You humiliated me and disgraced me, adding to my mental disturbance.   I left the army crazy and hallucinating and I became homeless for awhile until I was able to continue mental health care for the disorder that was in my record when you kicked me out of the army instead of recognizing that I was a good soldier in need of help. I challenged you to combatives and you declined.  I still remember you, Clark, and My offer is still open.  If you have a hair on your nutsack, come see me.  I will rip it off and feed it to you.", "Comment_ID": "10151702277006306_10153339269446306", "Commenter_ID": "10204299824118038", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10151702277006306", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2015-06-07T20:03:09+0000"}, {"Comment": "Again, thanks for all you've done over the last 2 years.

Cover upstairs windows with blackout curtains or thick blankets you use for winter on the inside of the provided white shades,  this keeps the place much cooler.  if temps get near 100 prepare for power failure.  Keep water bottles frozen in your freezer. turn the a down a bit, cover all windows down stairs the same way you keep the upstairs you can take the down stairs ones down once the temp drops.  This keeps the house much cooler when power goes out by blocking the sun. When power fails  stay outside until nightfall sprinklers are great. Move milk to the freezer.  The frozen water bottles can be used to keep cool and hydrated power is usually fixed by end of the night.", "Comment_ID": "10151698562276306_27394456", "Commenter_ID": "728423800543056", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10151698562276306", "Likes": 22, "Created_Time": "2013-07-10T01:51:15+0000"}, {"Comment": "People have lived without power for centuries...I think we'll all survive!! \n\nMaybe we'll have some spoiled food, but use your renters insurance provided through Corvias and get reimbursed", "Comment_ID": "10151698562276306_27394396", "Commenter_ID": "10101375742043965", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10151698562276306", "Likes": 16, "Created_Time": "2013-07-10T01:46:58+0000"}, {"Comment": "Thanks for the update and thanks fort Riley for providing a place for us to go", "Comment_ID": "10151698562276306_27394368", "Commenter_ID": "10202546970687860", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10151698562276306", "Likes": 11, "Created_Time": "2013-07-10T01:45:46+0000"}, {"Comment": "Just saying for future reference unless your single u are not required to live on base it is a choice and a privilege if you don't like how things are just live off base", "Comment_ID": "10151698562276306_27394671", "Commenter_ID": "755597821141923", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10151698562276306", "Likes": 10, "Created_Time": "2013-07-10T02:09:52+0000"}, {"Comment": "Wow, way to be ungrateful.

The experts at Fort Riley's Directorate of Public Works shared with us a few points to consider about roundabouts. This information was posted in the 1st Infantry Division Post newspaper, but we think it is important to share here, too: \n\nRoundabouts are traditionally safer than traffic circles and intersections with traffic lights because fewer accidents occur in roundabouts. The accidents that do occur are typically less severe than those that occur at traffic circles and signalized intersections. \n\nRoundabouts are also safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Roundabouts improve traffic flow and can accommodate U-turns. \n\nRoundabouts are more environmentally friendly because they do not require electricity and result in less gas usage due to stop and start traffic flow. Roundabouts can also function during power outages.", "Comment_ID": "10151670917661306_27242656", "Commenter_ID": "80248171305", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10151670917661306", "Likes": 2, "Created_Time": "2013-06-26T20:48:52+0000"}, {"Comment": "dumbest idea ever, no one here even knows how to properly navigate a roundabout, theres gonna be more traffic because of that.", "Comment_ID": "10151670917661306_27238547", "Commenter_ID": "10203591568382243", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10151670917661306", "Likes": 4, "Created_Time": "2013-06-26T15:17:01+0000"}, {"Comment": "Thank you for explaining the purpose of the roundabouts!

I would be more concerned with trapping and testing mosquitoes where people are living, playing and working. The low laying areas around the Forsyth main park by the neighborhood center seem to come to mind immediately. Being familiar with the types of environments that mosquitoes like to live and breed, the lack of adequate drainage, in an area where people are playing every day, especially small children would seem like a place to start trapping, testing and spraying. I'm sure Forsyth isn't the only neighborhood with drainage issues but since our yard backs up to that commons area and we frequently walk to the park we are aware of this every day problem. To me this would be an area of prime concern.

You also can call 785-239-9435 or visit www.rileymwr.com to learn about any of these program. \n\nAnother program I would highly recommend is the Resilient Spouse Academy. The next session will be in January and addresses issues to include financial readiness, suicide prevention, substance abuse and domestic violence prevention. The program is aimed to provide you with skills to cope and succeed despite the stressors of military life. A similar program - Resilient Youth Academy - is geared toward children and will take place in November and in March. To learn about RSA/RYA, contact Julie Zwiebel at 785-239-9435.\n\nLike suggested in the column, we would love for you to get involved and voice your concerns through official outlets.

We're sharing things with you that have been shared with us at some point or another. Or that we've learned by observing other women. Michelle didn't know everything when she started out either--but considering she's been at this gig since you were about a year old, I'd say she knows a thing or two about being an Army Wife and has earned the right to share what she's learned. I can also vouch for the fact that she's not stuck up in the least bit. \n\nAs far as I go, I'm new to the wife aspect of this but I kind of got a head start being a Navy brat and dealing with deployments from a young age.\n\nNone of us would disagree that emotional support is absolutely imperative during these years apart. The Army has set up outlets to find such support but you have already made it very clear in previous online discussions that you want nothing to do with the FRG. Unfortunately, by refusing to utilize that very valuable resource, you're completely limiting yourself in the amount of support you could find. If you have issues with the FRG, the best way to deal with those is to join it, be an active part of it and strive to change whatever negative perceptions you might have had. \n\nAs far as the other issues you raised (taking out trash, bills, juggling life as a single mom with a young child..), the Army isn't obligated to help us with those. Single moms deal with these issues every day of the year, military or not. The single moms outside the military just don't have an end date in sight for their stress and for that, my hat is off to them. These are areas in which we have to learn to adapt and be independent. You learn to run the trash out while your child is napping--trash bag in one hand, baby monitor in the other. You learn that 26 pounds isn't really that much to wear around on your back (the carriers are generally rated to over 40) and you learn to view it as bonding time AND a good workout! You learn how to use a crock pot so you don't have to think about cooking meals with a baby underfoot. And most of all, you network through your FRG so you have friends who you can trade off childcare with--so you don't go totally insane. \n\nThese are things women all over the world have to deal with, the main difference being that a lot of those women don't have the close community of the Army to learn from or support them. Add to that the fact that a good majority of those women are working full time jobs on top of taking care of children. It's part of being an adult and being an independent spouse. Is it fun? Generally, no, though having a baby on my back while I haul in groceries is so second nature by now that I don't even notice. But it is absolutely possible if you're willing to just work with your circumstances and take the responsibility on yourself instead of putting it on the Army. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying this because I think I'm better than you. I'm saying this to encourage you and the others you refer to to become more self sufficient in matters of personal responsibility. It's a steep learning curve, but thousands of women have done it more times than you or I have and they have managed quite well.", "Comment_ID": "10150337338114221_19112024", "Commenter_ID": "10202532388579583", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10150337338114221", "Likes": 4, "Created_Time": "2011-10-15T01:55:34+0000"}, {"Comment": "(sorry for the novel-length post :)", "Comment_ID": "10150337338114221_19112030", "Commenter_ID": "10202532388579583", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10150337338114221", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2011-10-15T01:56:02+0000"}, {"Comment": "You read my mind, Gwen!

We have the FRG, multiple classes and training for spouses and good old fashioned advice from women who have \"been there done that\". This post is actually really great where these things are concerned! Just check the monthly schedules that get posted either on this page or on our unit page! Not only are these events informative, they serve as great forums for networking with other wives. One of the best opportunities for first-timers was/is the Resilient Spouse Academy. The resources are there but you have to utilize them! (I realize you've figured out what works for you, so when I say \"you\", I'm using it an all-inclusive sense)\n\nOn top of that, spouses of deployed soldiers get an allotted amount of free childcare hours on post so they CAN attend these classes and get-togethers. \n\nOur FRG (yes, you and I are in the same unit) is wonderful, incredibly informative and very welcoming. I have personally learned a ton from these women and it's largely because of their advice and encouragement that this deployment has gone so smoothly. \n\nI understand that not all FRGs are created equal, but as we've said previously, the best way to remedy issues you see with them is to become involved. \n\nAs far as your charge that many wives \"act like they have no weakness\": There isn't one army wife that doesn't have some sort of weakness. However, it's completely normal to develop a pretty thick skin. You have to. I know for myself, I rarely discuss negative things that are going on in my life with anyone but my dearest friends. Keeping a positive attitude around the general public and my fellow Army wives helps keep morale up and foster a healthy, happy environment. So yes, to you, Desiree, it might look like I or [insert name] have no weaknesses or problems but trust me, we all do. We're just judicious about who we share them with. \n\nHere's what I would encourage you to do: try going to an FRG meeting. It's not going to kill you. Try meeting some other gals in the unit and go into it without painting everyone as \"stuck up\", \"thinks they're perfect\", or \"knows it all\". I think you'll see that there are a lot more resources available to spouses than you currently realize and it will also give you a chance to get involved and share what has worked for you this past year. More programs are no replacement for the life experience of wives who have gone before us and eventually, WE will be those wives.", "Comment_ID": "10150337338114221_19113710", "Commenter_ID": "10202532388579583", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10150337338114221", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2011-10-15T05:04:52+0000"}, {"Comment": "Will the lack of a traffic light on the intersection of Trooper Drive/ Rifle Range Rd be brought up?

If you are not working on Riley then why would you need access?", "Comment_ID": "10100387518666343_5873332", "Commenter_ID": "10204936426188882", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10100387518666343", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2011-07-12T20:23:17+0000"}, {"Comment": "I see people have their phone on speaker and holding it up right to their mouth lol I guess they dont realize thats not really hands free", "Comment_ID": "80248171305:10150251784636306:10101331650483551_10100168412287398", "Commenter_ID": "10154251083225637", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10150251784636306", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2011-07-08T15:44:25+0000"}, {"Comment": "And, yet, so many still do", "Comment_ID": "80248171305:10150251784636306:10101331650483551_10100168412312348", "Commenter_ID": "10154319502123750", "Post_ID": "80248171305_10150251784636306", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2011-07-08T15:44:49+0000"}, {"Comment": "It should cost a lot more than $50.

We bought alarms to go on our doors so we can hear if they open the door. They were $9 for 2 alarms. Not hard to install at all.

They were also climbing into the tubes that goes under he road. I called and the MPs never showed up.

In fact, normally he likes to meet with 6 or 8 spouses ... what if we'd not taken a shot at the full town hall and he only met with 6 or 8?  I would hope instead that you could be happy for those that got to attend.\n\nAs McKenna noted, we had representation from every rank on the installation, and every unit.  There is always the possibility that someone would feel left out, but I hope what you understand is that we went through a very deliberate process to insure everyone was fairly represented, rather than making accusations that people were purposely left out.  The mix of spouses was completely representative.  Bad blood only comes when you don't trust that the folks here aren't against you - they're with you.

I encourage everyone that is eligible for our services to utilize them. We are cheap...free! Our experienced prepares might be aware of other tax benefits that you might be eligible for that some of these home software programs don't tell you about.   We are located in building 7826 across from Normandy Chapel the corner of Normandy and Hale.  We are open from 8-6 M-F and 9-1 on Saturday.  We have an equal number of prepares doing scheduled clients and walk-ins.  Saturday is strictly walk-ins.  The tax center is able to file 2007, 2008 and 2009 federal returns and all state returns. We are able to e-file directly with the IRS allowing you to get your refund within 10-14 working days.  You do need to bring social security cards for all people on your return but if you don't have them you can always get a verified letter from the Social Security office in Manhattan, KS.    If your spouse is deployed you can still file if you have a Special or General Power of Attorney.  If you are expecting a refund I suggest you file as soon as possible and if you have a tax liability I suggest you wait until the last day possible to pay.

We live in Manhattan with our young son.  We chose housing just off one of the many walking/bike paths in town and nearby Cico park.  There is always something to do.

Their children's programs are wonderful.  If you are into sports, K-State is right here in town and often offers discount military tickets.  It's also nice to live closer to our favorite stores and restaurants.  Our son attends Amanda Arnold Elementary School and we are very pleased with the staff and teachers there.  They are offering tremendous support to our son in dealing with his Daddy's deployment.  For the outdoors people, check out Tuttle Creek lake, Milford Lake and Ft Riley rec areas.

Stay true to who you are, and dont believe the rumor mill, it will only make things worse.  As everyone else said, dont over communicate, we want to know whats going one but we really dont need to know that your out of milk and eggs.  If you overspend because  some of the savings you where planning on making, be honest about spending and tell them what it was for, a good spouse will always understand.  I believe the spouse at home has it much worse, we get feed without cooking or cleaning up, our laundry, for the most part is done for us, and we drive military vehicles that we dont have to pay for when they break down.

Your children have to be registered on post and the cost is 2.50 to 3.50 per hour.  Since they have opened this facility alot more slots have opened.  I know it is inconvenient to have to pay for it, but the gyms on the hill are a short drive and King Field House is only 10 minutes away.  Also, space is VERY limited at King Field House and we ALL need to realize that if  a child care facility is put in there that we will most likely have to say goodbye to the skating rink.", "Comment_ID": "104593664411_3450384", "Commenter_ID": "10206347968717917", "Post_ID": "80248171305_104593664411", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2009-07-31T20:57:59+0000"}, {"Comment": "Thanks Tara - there are definitely good options for childcare already.  What I'm trying to get a feel for is whether childcare in the fitness center would make a difference.  I think for some, if we could help cut out those 10 or 20 minutes going to and from childcare, it might help a few more spouses get freed up just long enough to get to the gym and back for a short period.  Still, you're right, for those that aren't pressed for time, Warren is a great choice.\nCOLB", "Comment_ID": "104593664411_3458582", "Commenter_ID": "10205795428277198", "Post_ID": "80248171305_104593664411", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2009-08-01T04:45:59+0000"}, {"Comment": "my husband!
