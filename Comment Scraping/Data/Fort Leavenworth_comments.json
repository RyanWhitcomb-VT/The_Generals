Since 1989, retirees and 100% disabled veterans and their dependents have been eligible to use these facilities. Today, only one is in operation, Edelweiss Lodge and Resort, located in Garmisch, Germany. In June 2015, a EUCOM (formally USAREUR) JAG reinterpreted the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and decided that all currently serving active and reserve component military personnel, all military retirees, all 100% disabled veterans and dependents, not assigned to or residing in EUCOM/Germany are no longer entitled to use Edelweiss, despite an official policy letter in 1989 that authorizes their use of the AFRC in Europe. The EUCOM CG accepted this reinterpretation/opinion. So, for over 25 years there has been no problem but on one opinion, our benefit vanished.  But now,  German military members, NATO military members, U.S. diplomatic officials and U.S. civilians employed by the U.S. government in EUCOM are entitled to use our facility. What an insult. A majority of U.S. military I.D. card holders are excluded while service personnel from other countries and our politicians can use our facility. Our earned benefit was stolen through an administrative decision, without the knowledge of our elected officials or considering the negative impact this has on so very many people. It does not matter whether you have ever used the AFRC in Germany or whether you will ever use it. This is simply yet another lost/stolen benefit. Since June 2015, congressmen/women and senators have been receiving letters of complaint over this loss, however, we are just now starting to see some movement in restoring our benefit. This action can easily be corrected with a change to AER 600-700 by the same EUCOM CG who denies us the use of Edelweiss. The German government did not cause this debacle, nor did the U.S. State Department.\n     I am requesting that all readers of this information immediately write to your elected officials and ask them what they are personally doing to have this earned benefit returned. Some elected officials have responded in a positive manner while other have simply quoted the Edelweiss L&R eligibility criteria, which we already know. If you have not seen the new eligibility criteria, go to www.edelweisslodgeandresort.com and scroll down to \u201celigibility criteria.\u201d Be prepared for the insult.  Help us save this benefit. We are in a very critical period which will decide the fate of this benefit but we must maintain pressure on Washington.\n   In this first quarter of 2016, we need many new letters of protest hitting Washington. Please complain to your congressmen/women and senators. If we let this benefit fade away quietly, what is next?", "Comment_ID": "10153168791902611_10153280292382611", "Commenter_ID": "1216729875023089", "Post_ID": "86506442610_10153168791902611", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2016-02-10T21:43:26+0000"}, {"Comment": "Gannon Robinett", "Comment_ID": "10153167767362611_10153169396512611", "Commenter_ID": "10202906299637992", "Post_ID": "86506442610_10153167767362611", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2015-12-09T22:32:02+0000"}, {"Comment": "Gannon Robinett", "Comment_ID": "10153167579867611_10153169513702611", "Commenter_ID": "10202906299637992", "Post_ID": "86506442610_10153167579867611", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2015-12-10T00:42:39+0000"}, {"Comment": "This is all good advice and I always recommend having a house sitter or pet sitter come by and check the house once a day, bring in any newspapers and check the temeratures of  the house / adjust the heat as needed with the fluxuating cold temeratures.", "Comment_ID": "10153166149632611_10153178372722611", "Commenter_ID": "1473505546310449", "Post_ID": "86506442610_10153166149632611", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2015-12-15T16:32:35+0000"}, {"Comment": "Deer in the Px parking lot early in the morning.

That prophet was a close friend of Moses named Joshua and he was \u201cfilled with the spirit of God.\u201d Jesus identified with the God (love) that \u201cspoke\u201d to Moses and Joshua and Elijah and all the other prophets so completely that he could speak of himself as that God. Therefore, Jesus would say that when Moses and Joshua and Elijah said that \u201cthe Lord\u201d said something it was just as if they were speaking of Jesus saying it. All of these people warned people about the dangers posed by those who did not live by the golden rule and they ridiculed, mocked, made fun of them for their ridiculous ideas (1st Kings 18), met them in ferocious bloody battles, and executed their false prophets all with the approval and help from God or Jesus in other words.\n\nJesus\u2019 mission, he said, was to bring good news (gospel) to Israel that they could run the Romans out and \u201crestore\u201d control of the kingdom to Israel if they\u2019d trust him and what he was teaching which was the golden rule that would unite them in love for each other instead of them being divided into numerous arguing sects. If they didn\u2019t listen to him, however, they\u2019d die in their sins or as slaves to Rome in other words. In other words, Jesus said, \u201cI didn\u2019t come to tell you to compromise and make peace with Rome. I came instead to raise an army (church) and start a war with Rome in the near future and teach you how to make peace with God at the same time. \n\nSo, when Joshua, in Joshua 24, said that Israel needed to choose that very day who they would serve but as for himself and his family they would serve \u201cthe Lord\u201d it was precisely the same as saying that he was going to obey Jesus. This was the same Joshua that \u201cthe Lord\u201d had told to annihilate all the people in the land of Canaan that did not practice the golden rule but worshiped Baal instead that required human sacrifices and all kinds of other terrible things. In fact, in 24:20 Joshua warned the people that if they abandoned \u201cthe Lord\u201d or the golden rule in other words, God (Jesus) would make terrible things happen to them like foreign nations enslaving them as Assyria, Babylon, Greece, and Rome did later on once they\u2019d thoroughly abandoned the practice of the golden rule enough. \n\nNow, Islam with its Sharia law that\u2019s totally opposite to the golden rule and enforces so many of the same kinds of atrocities done by those who worshiped Baal, is taking control of the entire world for the same reason Israel was enslaved. The 2nd amendment is based on the golden rule and every Christian is commanded by Jesus via the golden rule and that 2nd amendment to defend themselves, their families, and America with lethal force from that enemy who is being aided and abetted by people in high places filled with demonic spirits. It was true in the days of Joshua and it\u2019s just as true today. The Pope is wrong! \u201cNo one,\u201d said Jesus, \u201ccan legitimately claim to be my disciple and be saved and not do what I say.\u201d \n\nOprah has believed the centuries old lie, a lie that\u2019s promoted by Muslims using taqiyya, that \u201cspiritual warfare\u201d is just an inner struggle with one\u2019s conscience to be a good person and that Islam has nothing to do with terrorism when, in reality, it\u2019s fundamentally based on terror. Simply by reading the oldest and most authoritative Muslim materials and the Bible it\u2019s easy to see that nothing could be further from the truth. Obama says that Islam should be judged by what it is rather than what it isn\u2019t. Well, Islam can\u2019t possibly be a religion of peace and tolerance because it has everything to do with terrorism.\n\nThe golden rule has been twisted by false teachers to mean that rapists, pedophiles, thieves, slavers, and murderers are to receive your sympathy rather than those you love and who have the natural right to expect you to care for them just as you\u2019d want them to care for you. And, the second amendment has been twisted to mean that armed and well regulated militias are the right of the government instead of that God given or natural right, as the amendment plainly says, belonging to \u201cthe people\u201d apart from government control for the very purpose of staying free from being enslaved by tyrants wanting to enslave you.\n\nSo, choose today. Will you be enslaved or murdered along with everyone you love? My family and I are armed and we\u2019re going to try to stay free and serve the Lord. See Acts 4:19\n\nSee the following site \u201cMyths of Islam\u201d for a much more thorough understanding of authentic Muslim doctrine on terrorism right from the most authoritative Muslim sources: http://thereligionofpeace.com/pages/myths-of-islam.htm", "Comment_ID": "10153125990867611_10153126607732611", "Commenter_ID": "498172633620574", "Post_ID": "86506442610_10153125990867611", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2015-11-11T00:01:43+0000"}, {"Comment": "Kansas City Zoo is offering: Bring your family and spend Veterans Day at the Kansas City Zoo.

Important to note that this is a temporary delay and not a cancellation of the furlough, while DOD sorts through the fiscal implications of a continuing resolution.  This means that you should not expect a furlough notice to arrive until approximately April 5th. This would mean that furlough dates will also be pushed to begin no sooner than early May. This could have an impact on the overall number of furlough days, but currently there is no indication of any decision this will lessen the number of required furlough days from the planned 22 days.\r\n\nI would ask you all to remain flexible in the coming days as this delay will cause us to readjust our own timelines for such things as the Furlough Supervisory Training Session, and the next post-wide Town Hall meeting.  We will do our best to ensure that you have the latest information as it becomes available.

The GC watches local conditions for their effect on the Army community, but gets paid to keep FT Fort Leavenworth systems open and available.  He or she relies on the commanders and directors across post to make decisions at their level that best meet the needs of their organization.

However, I would say keep it open for in and outbound until 6:30. If they would've kept the commercial/visitor traffic coming through Hancock it would meet their little quota. Having it closed on the weekends/holidays isn't really a huge deal either. I would be upset if I lived on Kansas though. That is already a tight area with houses on top of each other and a TON of kids. I have already had to stop suddenly MANY times for kids darting in and out of traffic. How long until a child gets hit by a car until post realizes $300,000 isn't too much money compared to the life of a child?! Also did they think that maybe they could shift a guard or 2 over from Grant after their peak hours, say from 1530 on. Traffic there diminishes greatly after people get back from lunch and high school students are done with school. There is no reason for all the extra guards standing around at Grant or having 4 lanes open after 1530. Sounds like someone did this as a quick and easy fix. Also, they could pull a MP or 2 off the road or from sleeping in cars to cover the gates. I have been at many larger posts and never seen such an MP presence on the roads as I do here and this is a TINY post.
