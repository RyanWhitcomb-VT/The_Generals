If they hadn't threaten the delegates,  Cruz would have won nomination at the convention.  We need him bad. Or we're going to end up with hillary. He is the only one that can beat hillary.  Trump cannot debate hillary or anyone.  She needs someone ghat will shred her in debates,  which trump also wants out of.  That will be horrible.  If you need RNC # message me. Contact your representative in you area. Trump is really a dangerous man with a bad record & more lawsuits voming. Research him, and please let your congress men know you will not support the gop if they don't remove trump.

Participants of this Facebook page will agree, not a single one of our US veterans should ever be in need, what with all the wealth in this country and all the billions in profit so many have made on the wars fought by these honorable warriors.  Sadly many of our veterans suffer daily and are in need.....Please do whatever you can, even if it is just $5.    \n\nI've shared this post on the Facebook pages of  the Governor, Lt. Gov., Attorney General of the state of Texas, as well as the Facebook pages of the Texas Legislators, US Congress, US Military, and the Department of Defense.  ~ Triena Rogers\n------------------------  \nToday is the perfect day to step and do something to help a veteran! Nothing very complicated and for those near me locally this particular link helps veterans right here in Texas/Oklahoma in Texoma. Check this out, and if you can donate $5 today - do it! If you can do more .... go for it. This is an awesome program and 25 Veterans - who are currently homeless - will have a roof over their head very soon. What they are missing is the 'stuff' to go under the roof! By definition homelessness means you don't have plates, silverware, beds, chairs and all that stuff. This donation program will help make a house a home. http://www.tcog.com/vash/. An opportunity to do something that will immediately make a difference. And if you're not in my area check out your local area/State.
