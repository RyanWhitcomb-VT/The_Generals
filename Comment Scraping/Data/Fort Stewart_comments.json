I have to say that I don't mind the price increase from $1 to $2 but I found it pretty ridiculous that I had to pay $2 for me just to be able to sit inside the fence to watch my kids. Nobody with kids under 5 is going to sit outside the fence while their toddler is running around in there esp when you are there when it isn't toddler time. What is the point of having kids under 2 free if you are just going to charge for the parent to go in with them. That isn't right. Also, it would be nice if you all offered some kind of family pass like you do for the pool paying 6 bucks a day almost every day gets expensive for everyone if you go multiple times a week.", "Comment_ID": "10150907156592072_23116329", "Commenter_ID": "10205217900106336", "Post_ID": "116888017071_10150907156592072", "Likes": 4, "Created_Time": "2012-05-20T04:32:40+0000"}, {"Comment": "why do I have to pay for me to stand inside and watch my kid??...

I have five children and with myself it would cost $10. Per day (I have a one yr old). Because I am out numbered I prefer the water park over the pool when my husband is not around. It is just safer and easier for us. I would go everyday ic it was not so expensive for us. I think they would deff be parents buying a season pass to this park if it was offered. I hope this option is considered by the staff if it has not already. I think more options to pay would increase buisness this summer. Maybe an unlimited pass to include skating lazer tag bowling and all activities as well. Also there could be an \" aqatics pass\" that would include a pass to all water activities and the pool. Obvikusly these passes would be mpre expensive but well worth it to large familys and or daycare providers (there are many of us on base). This would gice us safe things to do with the kids and help keep these activities funded.

The MWR listened to patrons and have built this wonderful dog park for the military community to keep dogs from running around where children play. I applaud the MWR for doing this and hope it keeps dogs off the playing and running fields. Lack of backyard space and a lack of a dog park is one of the reasons myself and my husband Joel O'Malley decided to buy a house in Hinesville with a big yard for our 2 dogs, but we are responsible dogs owner, not only do we not let them run free, but when we lived on post, we never disrespected the residents by allowing them to run free in play or running areas. It helps too that we understand and read the signs that say \"no dogs\"", "Comment_ID": "10150534781707072_6212355", "Commenter_ID": "10201999876023824", "Post_ID": "116888017071_10150534781707072", "Likes": 3, "Created_Time": "2012-01-13T13:45:56+0000"}, {"Comment": "Rachael I have to disagree. My friends daughter was attacked by a pitbull for no reason. They had the dog since it was 8 weeks old, NEVER hit him or did anythin to provoke him. They made sure their daughter didn't play rough and the dog would sleep wrapped around the child. He was very protective too. Then one day, out of nowhere, the dog snapped and mauled the child's thigh. Poor girl had to have 7 surgeries. It's in their nature to attack.

Two years ago, there was  line out the door of people trying to get their kids into the daycare.  Since they re-opened after the fire, no one seems to use it anymore. Probably because they don't offer the classes anymore.  Regardless, the daycare gives me the opportunity to squeeze in an hour at the gym.  Yes, the times are limited, but it works for me.  I put $30 in my daycare account at CYS, go to the gym 3-4 days a week, and this usually lasts a month.  I do 30 mins of cardio and 30 mins of weight training.  $30 is cheaper than the YMCA and certainly worth being in shape :)", "Comment_ID": "10150350647667072_19588630", "Commenter_ID": "10152351287824629", "Post_ID": "116888017071_10150350647667072", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2011-10-05T14:51:59+0000"}, {"Comment": "The hours are not good and it is way too expensive!

The Fort Stewart Pet Boarding can only board dogs for 90 days due to kennel stress for the welfare of the pets.  For deployments and extended TDY/School periods, Dogs need to have a Family Care Plan in a home environment like other family members.  Remember your pets are Family members, and are not throw away items.  This is an excellent option for those who do not have family or friends to care for their pets in the midst of a deployment. Be sure to document have both parties all transactions, get an agreement in writing and prepare an allotment for food, vet bills, and upkeep of your pet during your absences. A Pet Power of Attorney will help your caretaker with vet and professional transactions as well. \n\nCome see us at the Fort Stewart Pet Boarding Facility. We offer grooming, doggie daycare and boarding.
