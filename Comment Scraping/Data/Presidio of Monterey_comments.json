This means that we start purchasing that starter home at age 35-40+, which equates to completing our loan in our 60's-70's.

Tattoos do NOT make a person less professional, attitude and actions dictate that.  As for appearance, the military has had regulations dictating sexist, racist, gang related and any other offensive items are restricted and not allowed.  If they can be covered while in full Class A's then it shouldn't matter.  As for neck and hand tattooes, well, I'm not a fan and I don't particularly agree with them being allowed in the services as they can't be covered by the long sleeves of the class a jacket, but in all truth, if a person is willing to serve and possibly die for their country and what they believe in, what the heck does it matter how much ink they have or where it is located.", "Comment_ID": "10152420977988882_10152436395358882", "Commenter_ID": "748094848559905", "Post_ID": "192848048881_10152420977988882", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2014-09-09T06:41:03+0000"}, {"Comment": "I wonder how many of you have actually served.

It's the former Fort Ord, where the commissary, PX and most of the housing is. You'll get used to the various acronyms soon enough. The whole Army community is POM (Presidio of Monterey). But POM is also, specifically, the location of the Presidio, which is where DLI is (also known as DLIFLC or Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center). Also, on OMC is the DMDC (Defense Manpower Data Center) in the DOD Center. The DOD (Department of Defense) Center is the tall building on Gigling Road. It used to be a hospital in Fort Ord days. Also on Gigling Road, at the intersection with General Jim Moore Blvd, is the General Stilwell Community Center. Within the Stilwell Center is ACS (Army Community Service) and some FMWR (Family and Morale, Welfare & Recreation) offices.

One recurring theme is our cable, internet and phone service providers are NOT providing the quality of service most of you are accustomed to.  Our partners at Clark Pinnacle are working to get other servce providers to come in to provide these services to our communities while not allowing them to \"cherry pick\" where they would offer service.  What this means is we have to get them to commit to upgrading infrastructure throughout rather than coming into only, say Doe Park and providing service there where the project already has the backbone and they could start collecting user fees with very minimal investment.  Complicating the issue are contractual agreements the Army had in place prior to us going the privatized housing initiative.  Suffice it to say, the issue is being worked but few are happy with where we are right now and we hope to have improved services available to our residents in the near future.
