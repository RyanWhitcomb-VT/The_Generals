They tell of purposeful starvation of prisoners to punish the Confederacy (they had no food to give their prisoners) and save money (the commandant at Rock Island wrote letters in which he is proud of saving money by not feeding Confederate prisoners, letting them starve to death) and sentries who randomly shot helpless prisoners to death when they were asleep in their bunks, sitting in doorways and going to the sinks at night when they were ill.  The Union should be ashamed. Even your local newspapers protested the terrible treatment of prisoners. When my great-grandfather arrived, one of the first prisoners there, the barracks were not finished. Confederate prisoners were housed in barracks with huge cracks between the boards in the walls. They wore very worn clothing not suitable to northern winters and were not allowed to keep their blankets. Don't make it sound like they had creature comforts. They did not. You have access to the records and should not perpetuate the lie that it was a humane place.", "Comment_ID": "1212082278822766_1212096192154708", "Commenter_ID": "10207979983847118", "Post_ID": "158644827499855_1212082278822766", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2016-06-13T02:57:00+0000"}, {"Comment": "", "Comment_ID": "1212082278822766_1212192902145037", "Commenter_ID": "10201822147187364", "Post_ID": "158644827499855_1212082278822766", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2016-06-13T07:50:39+0000"}, {"Comment": "It took the White House a couple days to proclaim flags half mask when the marine recruit depot was targeted .", "Comment_ID": "1211861452178182_1211873615510299", "Commenter_ID": "1504027296549466", "Post_ID": "158644827499855_1211861452178182", "Likes": 2, "Created_Time": "2016-06-12T19:16:00+0000"}, {"Comment": "for those of you that seem to have a problem with this, 50 of your fellow countrymen were killed in the biggest mass shooting in US history.

Congress, by the Act of July 11, 1862, established three new arsenals: at Columbus, Ohio, Indianapolis, Ind., and on the Government-owned Island of Rock Island in the Mississippi River. At each site, Congress authorized the construction of one storehouse. Storehouse A, as the Clock Tower Building was originally known, became the first building of the new Rock Island Arsenal. On April 20, 1864, the cornerstone was laid. In 1931, a Rock Island District field construction office moved into the first floor of the Clock Tower Building to supervise the first work on the project, the construction of Locks and Dam 15, a few hundred feet away. Since Storehouse A had never been intended for anything but storage, much renovation was necessary. There were no permanent partitions, no water, and no passenger elevator. In a flurry of activity, often around the clock, in 1934, the District Engineer, Col. R. A. Wheeler, officially moved his office to the Clock Tower Building and a surrounding 6.9 acre triangle of land was transferred from the Ordnance Department to the Corps of Engineers.", "Comment_ID": "1063521647012164_1063528713678124", "Commenter_ID": "158644827499855", "Post_ID": "158644827499855_1063521647012164", "Likes": 6, "Created_Time": "2015-10-21T15:27:05+0000"}, {"Comment": "Miss the Arsenal my mom and dad are buried  there Rock island Is my hometown  miss it", "Comment_ID": "1063521647012164_1063669740330688", "Commenter_ID": "732690963449924", "Post_ID": "158644827499855_1063521647012164", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2015-10-21T22:15:11+0000"}, {"Comment": "It's about time", "Comment_ID": "1062700863760909_1062918683739127", "Commenter_ID": "10202660669615630", "Post_ID": "158644827499855_1062700863760909", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2015-10-20T09:18:55+0000"}, {"Comment": "This was a great event!

It is an opportunity for everyone who can't make other meetings to communicate and have our ideas/concerns addressed.  (Or maybe I just take a stronger concern for the place I work) :).                 .......   My question:  While traveling to other Army installations, some of them allow the civilian employees to utilize the Commissary and PX with full access.  Fort Leavenworth was one when I was there a few years back.  I continually read about the very real concerns of Commissary's shutting down and decreased military use of the PX because they can't compete with the \"big box\" stores.  Is there a way, since our Commissary and PX are so small, to request an exception for RIA to allow our civilian staff to utilize them both? (I know the PX has limited access right now).  I would think allowing the civilian workforce access would easily increase sales, especially for the Commissary as employees would stop for groceries on their way home. As a military brat, prior spouse, and civilian employee I fully support the Commissary's and PX's, and the convenience of having them near where one works is a strong draw as potential customers.  If other military installations can authorize civilian use (with a CAC), can RIA follow suit?

Here are the items I intended to post. 1. It's only Wednesday and the Rock Island gate has already been reduced to one lane twice during peak morning traffic... to top off the heater tanks! Both times created hazardous situations with motorists attempting to back out of the lane sudenly closed.... This solution is too easy: make it daily SOP to top off all the heater tanks at 0600, or whatever time precedes the main influx. Top them off again after the evening rush. In any case, have a plan, not just a reaction.  2. What benefits accrue from deploying the stop signs at the south end of Government Bridge when the Davenport Gate is closed? Th There is no cross traffic, so what's the point?  Seems to me it's a classic \"we've always done it this way.\"  Time for a proper assessment.  3. How hard would it be to place an illuminated sign at on westbound Rodman Ave, just before Sylvan Drive near the PX, indicating whether the Davenport Gate is open or closed?  Looks to me like another example of \"everybody knows the operating hours, so what's the problem?\" How about people new to RIA, or those of who use the gate infrequently?  Serve the people, not the servants... 4. A large number of Bldg 350 employees use the E/W road one block north of and  paralleling Rodman Ave. (sorry, the map won't tell me the name) to approach the Bldg 350 parking lot... the road is in a terrible state and seems never to make it onto the list of repairs.

With that said, how do you justify the hiring of 13 additional police officers for the purpose of increased law enforcement actions on a decreasing pool of federal employees who are predominantly business hours-only visitors to this island?  Is there also a need for increased law enforcement actions toward the island residents or golf course patrons because of some increased criminal activity during all hours of the day/night and weekends?  A nearly 50% increase in permanent police officer positions seems inconsistent with decreased operating budgets for all AMC Commands (including IMCOM) coupled with a low threat Force Protection Condition (Alpha) environment.  What is the current ratio of RIA police officer to criminal offenses committed?  Is it currently indicative of understaffing compared to the local communities that surround RIA?

The Army Safety Program (AR 385-10, Section 6-5) states -- Using headphones or earphones while walking, jogging, skating, and bicycling, including pocket bike, motorcycle or moped on Army installation roads and streets, is prohibited.  None of the regulations, instructions, or policies I have located state that sidewalks are included, and all of them refer to a sidewalk as a separate entity than a roadway or street. The Garrison response to an inquiry April 2014 was that all sidewalks at RIA are included in the ban on earphone use on roadways and streets yet the RIA policy only says roadways/streets.  I understand where there is no sidewalk in certain areas - like along the river/golf course - one must walk on the roadway and thus earphones should not be used, but sidewalks are designated for pedestrian use only and corner crosswalks have either stop signs or lights.  Why are we not allowed to wear ear-buds for music while walking on sidewalks on RIA?  And since Bluetooth, smart phone ear pieces and wired phone ear buds are all considered headphones/earphones, do they also come under this policy and are we restricted from using our phones using these devices on sidewalks?", "Comment_ID": "762004267163905_764050946959237", "Commenter_ID": "10204852403845623", "Post_ID": "158644827499855_762004267163905", "Likes": 2, "Created_Time": "2014-05-05T23:11:30+0000"}, {"Comment": "2015 is a scheduled BRAC year, correct?

However, in the 4th century, under the Byzantine Empire, the monastery built there was abandoned in favour of the newer belief that Mount Saint Catherine was the Biblical Mount Sinai; a new monastery - St. Catherine's Monastery was built at its foot, and the alleged site of the biblical burning bush was identified.  The bush growing at the spot (a bramble, scientific name Rubus sanctus,) was later transplanted several yards away to a courtyard of the monastery, and its original spot was covered by a chapel dedicated to the Annunciation, with a silver star marking where the roots of the bush had come out of the ground.  The Monks at St. Catherine's Monastery, following church tradition, believe that this bush is, in fact, the original bush seen by Moses, rather than a later replacement, and anyone entering the chapel is required to remove their shoes, just as Moses was in the biblical account.  However, in modern times, it is not Mount Saint Catherine, but the adjacent Jebel Musa, (Mount Moses,) which is currently identified as Mount Sinai by popular tradition and guide books; this identification arose from bedouin tradition.  Mount Serbal, Jebel Musa, and Mount Saint Catherine, all lie at the southern tip of the Sinai peninsula, but the peninsula's name is a comparatively modern invention, and it was not known by that name at the time of Josephus or earlier.  Most modern scholars, as well as many modern theologians, dismiss the idea that the biblical Sinai was at the south of the peninsula, instead favouring locations in the Hijaz, (at the north west of Saudi Arabia,) northern Arabah, (in the vicinity of Petra, or the surrounding area,) or occasionally in the central or northern Sinai Peninsula.  Hence, the majority of academics and theologians agree that if the burning bush ever existed, then it is highly unlikely to be the bush preserved at St Catherine's Monastery.", "Comment_ID": "257565244321307_1845442", "Commenter_ID": "10205497752696101", "Post_ID": "158644827499855_257565244321307", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2012-02-16T15:42:01+0000"}, {"Comment": "My heart breaks for the parents that lose their babies too soon.
