Their job is to report information and vet what is clear for public disclosure and they make no decisions to installation closures at all.  Therefore, complaining here is just openly complaining and they are doing their jobs by editing and removing those things that they do not feel should be on here... Now let's break down why.\n\nPost closure determination are also not made by their immediate commander in the Garrison either, they are made by the installation commander... who happens to be a Commanding General of the largest Organization on this post.   As such they are probably doing a lot of people a favor by removing negative and nasty comments that are based on personal ignorance... and why do I say personal ignorance, well here comes the key... pay attention now:\n\nThis installation has somewhere near 20k people on it and a LOT of money is lost when it closes and no work occurs.  This is the military and the closure is based on very specific things, none of which are where people chose to live.  We are all adults and trusted that we can make decisions based on our own safety.  \n\nPost closes when conditions on post make it unsafe to be on post or normal business can not occur.  This include being unable to clear parking lots, keep up with maintenance or something of that nature.  This generally also translates to the same issues around where people live but is completely exclusive in the decision. \n\nIn the case post is clear and business is able to operate, yet they know a lot of surrounding areas are still hazardous (and this is the important part) they post that Unscheduled Leave is authorized, leaving the decision to you as an adult.   So be an adult and save a couple days of leave if you live in an area that you know could be hazardous when post is not.   A failure to do so is your failure and no one else.  \n\nI like days off just like the rest of everyone else, but to cry about conditions where you are coming from just makes you look uninformed.    Hope everyone enjoys their day, no matter what personal decision they have made.  And thank you PAO for posting timely information as you have it.  Anyone with a legitimate complaint or concern would be welcomed to submit it to the commander via their organizational chain of command as well I am sure.... that is how true issues are handled.", "Comment_ID": "10153640880916284_10153642148456284", "Commenter_ID": "10205240894852437", "Post_ID": "238070186283_10153640880916284", "Likes": 14, "Created_Time": "2016-02-10T12:37:25+0000"}, {"Comment": "I thought we reassess at 6 AM?

It's obvious you don't really understand. I'll try to use short words for you to understand.

You may be able talk crazy on your personal FB, Twitter, or other online forums, but doing it on an official government social media site, whether you're a Soldier (which I doubt is the case), DA Civilian, or contractor, you may be held liable for your comments or actions. ALARACT 122/2015, which comes as part of an effort to address Soldier use of social media and other online forms of communication, also defines good behavior online, \"electronic communication,\" and \"online-related incident.\" The ALARACT emphasizes commanders' responsibility to \"reinforce a climate where current and future members of the Army team, including Soldiers, Army civilians, contractors, and Family members, understand that online misconduct is inconsistent with Army values.\" In a separate article, Government civilians are also subject to punishment for certain posts on social media, even when they're off duty, according to Eura Cherry, attorney at the Fort Belvoir Office of the Staff Judge Advocate.\n\n\"Employees should be aware that some of their off duty conduct may be deemed misconduct that is punishable by their employer,\" Cherry said. \"They should be mindful when utilizing social media and making posts which could be interpreted as defamatory, libelous, obscene, abusive, threatening, racially or ethnically hateful or otherwise offense or illegal.\" DIRK/DERK, Please be our test case.

But if this were a real shooting incident, would a person standing at the door of the building checking ID's do a thing to prevent a shooter from getting into a building?  Here's a chilling illustration of that - MAJ Nidal Hasan, the shooter at Fort Hood who killed 13 and wounded an additional 30, had his CAC around his neck when emptying his pistol and walking  between buildings.

I remember seeing this happen on every single base we lived on as a kid. With time being away from the military life during college years then coming back I was confused about if it was the same.  I am guilty of not stopping but I didn't know because I've never seen anyone stop on this base and I don't recall if it was done in Germany I didn't really drive during those hours. This is only our second duty station, lol! When I observed my hubby do flag duty I simply turn off my car and sat quietly, but the second time I got out my car and stood at attention (I didn't know which was right, lol)!  If we are outside when the bugle call comes we do accordingly but I've wondered about it while driving but never really asked the question. Don't judge me for walking in confusion so long when I could have simply asked!  I never think about it until it happens but most of the time I'm not out and about around that time.

On the second attack, Evans steered the ship naked standing at the stern shouting directions through an open hatch to sailors manually steering the ship below. On the third attack, the Johnston was sunk, but a Japanese ship sailed past the debris with their crew lining the rail and saluting the Johnston and crew. \n\nEvans would have been justified in withdrawing after his first attack, but he continued instead.\n\nOther ships, their crews, and aircraft of the U.S. acted heroically as well in the battle, but CDR Evans and the USS Johnston lead the way. The Leyte landing was saved, thousands of soldiers and Marines were saved, and this marked the last and largest significant naval battle of the war for the Japanese. Evans body was never found, and a headstone marks his empty grave in the Philippines. This was David and Goliath battle with no reasonable outlook for David. But the Japanese assumed from the ferocity of the attack that Halsey's fleet must be nearby, not decoyed away by another Japanese fleet. So they withdrew. \n\nRead about CDR Evans \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_E._Evans\n\nAnd read about the Battle off Samar. \n\n         Any coward can fight a battle when he's sure of winning;\n         but give me the man who has pluck to fight when he's sure of\n         losing.\n         That's my way, sir; and there are many victories worse than a\n         defeat.\n\n                    George Eliot (Marian Evans Cross)", "Comment_ID": "10152670727131284_10152672325636284", "Commenter_ID": "810860102259556", "Post_ID": "238070186283_10152670727131284", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2014-11-07T16:22:23+0000"}, {"Comment": "Rylie Diem you should check this out for us!", "Comment_ID": "10152667075046284_10152667596426284", "Commenter_ID": "10203948677815832", "Post_ID": "238070186283_10152667075046284", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2014-11-04T22:09:07+0000"}, {"Comment": "I love this picture.", "Comment_ID": "10152664811466284_10152667128541284", "Commenter_ID": "738649206191970", "Post_ID": "238070186283_10152664811466284", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2014-11-04T17:26:36+0000"}, {"Comment": "gotta work in edgewood", "Comment_ID": "10152664668791284_10152664672241284", "Commenter_ID": "804095399600680", "Post_ID": "238070186283_10152664668791284", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2014-11-03T16:22:21+0000"}, {"Comment": "Date is November 20th.

I have been frustrated for years by the regulation that says if we use our leave to leave early for our own personal safety, then they still charge our personal leave when they close post.  But if, and only if, we stick it out and wait for the chain of command to close post - well then we get free time off charged to admin leave.  It isn't fair.  And it's a judgment call often made when based on how much leave time is saved.  Some of us don't have a lot of leave time.  Our safety should be most important and everyone should be given the same type of leave when post is closed.  And just because in years past they didn't close post is an absurd argument for saying no one should complain today.  We often don't get this much snow.  It is a rare circumstance and that should have called for leadership to take a rare stance and close post earlier.", "Comment_ID": "10152026610341284_30346404", "Commenter_ID": "4423538403659", "Post_ID": "238070186283_10152026610341284", "Likes": 3, "Created_Time": "2014-01-21T22:51:33+0000"}, {"Comment": "Incidentally, this is why the Colonel decided to do away with the ATC Forum.

Colonel Brown also urges motorists to be cautious when traveling due to the possible hazardous conditions that may arise from the pending snow event. \n\nDuring snow storms, abandoned and disabled vehicles cause a major problem for snow removal equipment and for troopers responding to emergency situations. Troopers encourage those who do not need to travel during the storm to stay off the roads. \n\nIf motorists find it necessary to travel during this event, they are reminded of the highway restrictions should a snow emergency plan go into effect. Once in effect, parking is prohibited on any street or road designated as a snow emergency route. All vehicles are required to have approved mud and snow tires or chains while operating during a declared snow emergency. All abandoned or unattended vehicles will be towed from major roadways. \n\nIn the event of power failure, traffic lights may not function properly. In that case, the law requires all drivers approaching an intersection with a non functioning traffic light to stop. Drivers may proceed only after they have yielded to any vehicles or pedestrians already in the intersection. They must remain stopped until the intersection is clear and safe to proceed. \n\nFor the latest statewide emergency information, citizens are urged to visit the Maryland Emergency Management Agency website at www.mema.state.md.us. Up to the minute statewide traffic information, including road closures due to snow or ice is available on-line at www.511md.org, or by calling 511. Road conditions and views of live traffic cameras are also available on the State Highway Administration website at www.roads.maryland.gov. \n\nCitizens are advised not to call Maryland State Police barracks simply to check on road conditions. Calls to police or 911 centers during the storm should be for emergency situations only. \n\nMaryland State Police will be working closely with State Highway Administration and Maryland Emergency Management Agency officials throughout the storm. Marylanders are urged not to travel during the storm unless absolutely necessary. \n\nCONTACT:\tSgt.

I live on Pledge Court and the reception is not good at all.  The speakers need to be on each street possibly on both ends of the street or speakers built on the outside of our houses because we cannot here from the inside because we have our daily house activities going on and when we go outside it is muffled and hard to hear.  Please contact me by Private Message and I will help with this situation.  Many of my neighbors can never hear and I had to go tell them when we had the last Tornado Watch announcement, which I barely heard.  The system needs to be modernized for families today.  It needs to be fixed, so we can know if we need to take cover or if we are under any attacks.  I am a Veteran and we do live on a military base, which makes us more vulnerable.

However because the dining facility is closing Dec. 10, there is no way to recover the costs--several thousands of dollars. WHY THE DFAC IS CLOSING: The DFAC is closing due to the decreased number of Soldiers on APG after the Base Realignment and Closure. The operation of a military DFAC is governed by military regulation and based on Soldier population. Currently, there are less than 80 APG Soldiers who receive meal pay, or Basic Allowance for Subsistence. EATING OPTIONS: The installation does, however, offer the following eating options\u2014the shoppette Subways,  commissary deli, Burger King (set to open in November), Tim Horton's snack bar and coffee/pastry cart (C4ISR), ARGO mobile food service located throughout post, bowling alley grill, Donna\u2019s Pit Beef at the post theater, Sutherland Grill at Ruggles golf course cub house, Southside Grill in the APG South recreation center, Northside Grill in the APG North recreation center, ISG BBQ in the parking lot of Chesapeake Challenge, Top of the Bay (set to open Nov. 21), Anthony's Pizza  (PX Food Court) and the CUP building on APG South.
