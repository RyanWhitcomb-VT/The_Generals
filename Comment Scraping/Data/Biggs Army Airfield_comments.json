I concur with keeping the sleeves down, but factually, when the Army wore OG 107s we just rolled them up in garrison and there was no need for the \u201ccamo out\u201d kabuki dance. It wasn\u2019t about looking like Marines, or was it to produce a more \u201cprofessional\u201d appearance. Rolling sleeves was for pragmatics and the method used was IAW the KISS principle. The BDU \u201ccamo out\u201d complication in rolling up sleeves was just too complicated. Why do we have to keep making the same mistakes repeatedly? You want to improve morale then work harder to stop the erosion of military service benefits for service members and their families. Stop destroying the pension program, education, and medical benefits. Fix transition programs like ACAP and the MMRB, MEB, and PEB process. You want to make a uniform change that really helps then get rid of the PT belt! Rolling sleeves was never a benefit for Infantrymen or any warriors and is not pragmatic with the current combat uniforms. These combat uniforms are not designed to accommodate this unnecessary option.

Too many bright young soldiers, with unlimited potential, are treated so badly by their superiors.. and are not given the support and guidance they need. They are disillusioned and end up hating their time in service, and can't wait to get out. Therefore, never reaching their full potential of what they could gain, and what they can provide in service to the country. My son is one of those.. he always wanted to be a soldier, and went in with enthusiasm and hopes of making the military his lifelong career. Now, after only 3 years in, he is angry, unfulfilled, and is counting the days till he can get out. This is a terrible shame. The leadership that he should be able to look to for guidance and inspiration, instead seems impatient, uninterested and condescending toward the young soldiers they are supposed to be encouraging and helping to build into exemplary examples of an American soldier.

We dont need to offer recruits so much to join. We need to offer them a life adventure and changing experience.  Most of my young EM had the same complaint: misconception of the Army experience compared to what they saw on TV. Gone are the historic, wooden barracks, and salty NCOs with their colorful language. This is what many of them sought. Instead they found a corporate, liberal, GLBT croud , and an AR full of regs and a path to early medical retirement with college benefits. \n\nIf we raised our standards and offered some mystique to our military experience we would have a line out the door I honestly believe. Look at the USMC.\n\nWhile a junior EM in the Infantry I got sick and tired of hearing guys say they joined for the benefits.  It occurred to me then we shouldn't offer ANY for the first enlistment. When a soldier RE-UPs then give them the benefits.......and judiciously send them to the sexy schools ie BAC, air assault,  Ranger, Sapper, so they can get tabbed out and have the adventure they crave.\n\nYes enlistment would go down for a few years. But we're downsizing anyway. However when word got out of our new combat, warrior focused culture kids would come seeking escape from our meek, PC society.\n\nBut first we need to get rid of those nondeployable soldiers, and the leadership that created the environment that attracts and sustains them.\n\nI say conduct an APFT today Army wide. No preperation. If you dont pass 70% in the 17-21 age group (no matter your age. I could at 50) then you're out today. No makeup. No profile. No mercy.

How many times do I have to be trained on sexual harassment? If a soldier hasn't figured it out by the time they complete basic, then they're not compatible with the military. \n- I haven't seen any actual \"leadership\" training yet.

I tried to explain that I want someone to teach us how to be good, inspiring, moral, and persuasive leaders. He didn't understand.

Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut.\n- the new rules forcing NCO's to complete the next level schools prior to being eligible for promotion (as it was explained to us this past weekend) is nothing more than a ploy to further stress morale, and attempt to diminish our devoted military.\n- our warrior culture is being administratively trampled out, and we are becoming a force of bean counting, desk jockey, cry babies that are being taught to mindlessly accept this new softer Army...all while the world burns around us.\n\n...Rant over...", "Comment_ID": "10153734388654063_10153735254514063", "Commenter_ID": "10206139891239165", "Post_ID": "178524104062_10153734388654063", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2015-09-23T12:25:07+0000"}, {"Comment": "I really do miss you!

In the middle of training and deployments, several NCOERs of senior NCOs got past me and were posted to their OMPF when nothing on the report had been verified by an NCO in the chain of concern and the officers through the battalion commander allowed this.  This causes disruption in the ranks with leadership, and with counselings and punishments for those NCOs.  Simply put another signature block for a 1SG/CSM after the senior rater as proof the company has verified all data.

During the decade plus years of high optempo of executing OIF and OEF, which became increasingly unpopular required enlistment standards to become waiverable to meet end strength requirements.  Great men and women stepped up to embrace the call to duty when others looked the other way.  All served this great nation and some gave their all.  Too many!  Can we do a better job of screening applicants?  I'm sure we can and the question demands a comprehensive staff review of current policy.  However predetermining whether a Soldier will cross the line of integrity and violate the trust bestowed in them or more importantly that of their fellow Soldier or those whom they may lead is a daunting challenge.  I submit that a culture change is in fact what is needed.  On this point I completely agree.  It must start with enlistment standards and indoctrination (more so that currently exists) of values, standards expectation, discipline, and unwavering trust in fellow Soldiers and leaders.  Especially in leaders that they will listen and take appropriate and immediate actions as established by law and UCMJ.  Soldiers must trust that they can report incidents without fear of reprisal or harassment.  I charge NCOs to become more involved with those in their charge and make values based training a constant discussion and validate that their Soldiers know that violation of Army values, trust, and the rule of law will not be tolerated.  Current DoD and Army policy and UCMJ will be revised and chain teaching will follow, however I believe we must make this type of training, critical as it and other such requirements become an enduring part of any/all institutional training.  Where POIs do exists, review and improve!!  As we move forward to opening more of our combat  MOSs to female Soldiers we absolutely MUST get this right!!  America will not trust their sons and daughters to serve in the best and most professional armed forces in the world if we fail at this!!  I do not pretend to have the solution and believe that the comprehensive Army Staff Study that must occur should consider all viable courses of action that pass the common sense test.

Somewhere in all the madness of ppt, slides decks, online training, ect, we have lost this Character building craft. Standing shoulder to shoudler and passing on those good words of character from our leaders is where the real conversation exists. Personal Excellence comes from us sharing the same time and sweat we ask of our folks. In those moments and in that time spent, we pass on character.", "Comment_ID": "10151645442559063_10420138", "Commenter_ID": "728088900653804", "Post_ID": "178524104062_10151645442559063", "Likes": 2, "Created_Time": "2013-06-05T14:18:41+0000"}, {"Comment": "Chris Rohloff , u shud try this!", "Comment_ID": "10151645442559063_10405961", "Commenter_ID": "639605312760316", "Post_ID": "178524104062_10151645442559063", "Likes": 0, "Created_Time": "2013-06-04T13:37:55+0000"}, {"Comment": "Cati lideri de la noi iau in calcul caracterul ca element esential in leadership?", "Comment_ID": "10151645442559063_10403311", "Commenter_ID": "764103350293245", "Post_ID": "178524104062_10151645442559063", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2013-06-04T06:44:49+0000"}, {"Comment": "That's  true!, a Leader has integrity, courage and valor to respond anything in the Battle!", "Comment_ID": "10151645442559063_10402778", "Commenter_ID": "1171590759595397", "Post_ID": "178524104062_10151645442559063", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2013-06-04T04:33:23+0000"}, {"Comment": "that's good knowledge for solder !", "Comment_ID": "10151645442559063_10402395", "Commenter_ID": "615322715250145", "Post_ID": "178524104062_10151645442559063", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2013-06-04T03:08:43+0000"}, {"Comment": "Roger that, Sir!", "Comment_ID": "10151645442559063_10401948", "Commenter_ID": "10205913923701635", "Post_ID": "178524104062_10151645442559063", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2013-06-04T01:57:51+0000"}, {"Comment": "This pic was taken when he was still a Lt.

Brian Jergens, stood proudly as his mom Roxy, and daughter Darcy, slipped his new shoulder boards into place officially marking him Sgt. Maj. Jergens. Also pictured is his wife Marilyn, who has been incredibly supportive of the academy and her husband. Before the orders were posted, USASMA Commandant Command Sgt. Maj. Rory Malloy, took a few minutes to talk about Jergens who served under Malloy as a medic when the two were deployed with the 1st Cav.  Malloy recalled how Jergens made things happen in a mere three weeks when Malloy sought him out for his expertise on what to do to get more immediate medical attention and supplies in place and train average Soldiers to give that immediate care for those wounded in battle. The commandant stopped briefly when recollecting how he was the one who had to deliver news to Jergens that his son Brian, had sustained serious injuries from an IED blast and lost both his legs. \"It was tough,\" said Malloy. Jergens was working in the Battle Staff Course and recalled the outpouring of support from his coworkers. \"My Battle Staff buddies are a phenomenal group. They stood beside me every day and helped me get through this tragedy,\" he said, \"And so did my wife, Marilyn. You don't do these things alone.\" Congrats SGM Jergens, thank you for your service to our country, and know you and your family are an important part of the USASMA family.

A E7 in my unit was cheating on his wife with an E4... but the leadership in our unit still though this person to have good integrity. It just doesn't work that way.

The latter means \"Enhancing Enlisted Education\" by developing curriculum that better prepares NCOs as analytical thinkers capable of providing battlefield counsel to commanders across a broad range of issues -- more strategic in nature. Not just tactical or task based support.\nTo use another example you'll see here often: We want to develop a broadly-skilled NCO who is agile, a critical and creative thinker, and a leader developer -- among other things.\nSo we're bringing in top-notch staff and faculty, plus building up curriculum in support of that focus. When we talk high-end curriculum, we mean that which taxes the high end of the student\u2019s cognitive domain. We also have more sergeants major with master\u2019s degrees on board as instructors to help do that. \nAnd by the way, that's also how we'll ensure coursework is accredited and, in the end, leads USASMA to becoming a degree-granting institution. \nTrue, we've always trained, and to some extent, educated our Soldiers; we're just upping the ante so to speak with regards to the educational portion. \nHerb: The little \"one-liners\" are known as teasers in the PR game, and are meant to get folks to think a bit, ask questions and dig for more information --- like you did.
