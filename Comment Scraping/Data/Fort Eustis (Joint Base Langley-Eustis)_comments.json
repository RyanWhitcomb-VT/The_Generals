This has to be the silliest solution to crime and traffic!!! Before this area became privatized bethel manor gate was only open when the buses were running. The Raptor entrance was blocked off. The only way into \"Bethel Manor\" was through first street. Although we had gate guards there was still crime in the neighborhood from the kids who lived here. A school bus was set on fire and middle schoolers stole spray paint from the sheds of their surrounding neighbors and tagged cars and houses. There will always be something. \nThe best solution would be to implement this again. Now, there will cars driving fast through raptor where people walk all the time and there children on bikes and skateboards. The speed limit of 15 is not going to be obeyed! It defeats the purpose of closing the entrance to first street considering the speed limit is 25. \nEither way someone is not going to be pleased but I've lived here long enough to know what has worked for this neighborhood and the safety of those living here.

Everyone from the beginning stated once the fences and gates were removed, crime would increase...and did anyone listen...nope.  Not until years later when crime has increased to include several individuals being assaulted did anyone realize the fences and gates should never have come down.  Opening up a clearly defined military community to the public is like baiting a kid with a piece of candy.  Criminals saw this as their cash cow.  Criminals are not dumb, they know what military members have in terms of personal items to include professional gear; e.g. deployment items.  They also have a perfect opportunity to sit and watch the habits of military members coming and going when the fences and gates are down,  more so than in the general pubic neighborhoods.  Bring back the security guards, put up the fences and protect those who serve to protect the country.  I'm actually amazed that a capital crime did not occur since the fences and gates were removed, e.g. a murder.  But I wonder, would that have even mattered?  You can change traffic patterns all day long, but criminals will do what they need to do to get around them as long as they have open access to the community. Put up a fence and or security guard and watch the crime drop significantly.

The aircraft maxed out at 259 mph. Fastest helicopter in the world today. The X2 is a coaxial helicopter.\n\nA coaxial helicopter has two sets of counter-rotating vertical blades. The blades counter-rotate, as opposed to both rotating in the same direction, to counter each other\u2019s angular momentum, which could make the aircraft unstable in flight. The counter-rotating blades eliminate the need for a stabilizing tail rotor. This configuration offers superior hovering power and stability.\n\nA compound coaxial helicopter combines both features in an attempt to provide both a dependable stable platform for hovering as well as high forward speed. Since coaxial helicopters do not need a conventional tail rotor, it is replaced with one or more larger, more powerful, airplane-like propellers for forward propulsion. A rear-mounted \u2018pusher\u2019 propeller is usually used, though more standard propellers may be mounted on outrigger wings.\n\nThe concept is said to be scalable, meaning that larger and more robust versions of this configuration are possible. Besides the standard civilian and military versions, Sikorsky envisions big heavy-lift descendants of the X2, which will be able to lift payloads of up to 40 tons and still fly at speeds of 250 knots or better.", "Comment_ID": "10153440971563692_10153441077558692", "Commenter_ID": "10152510907541189", "Post_ID": "324251608691_10153440971563692", "Likes": 2, "Created_Time": "2015-11-18T21:31:12+0000"}, {"Comment": "The S-97 Raider\nhttp://raider.sikorsky.com/", "Comment_ID": "10153440971563692_10153441067848692", "Commenter_ID": "10152510907541189", "Post_ID": "324251608691_10153440971563692", "Likes": 1, "Created_Time": "2015-11-18T21:25:23+0000"}, {"Comment": "Yes the the mighty A10.

Most secondary and residential streets are not clear. McCormick said crews will continue to clear roads, working in teams to drop salt and then scrape up ice.\n\nSince the beginning of the winter storm, the Hampton Police Division has responded to 155 storm related complaints and at least 181 disabled vehicles, six vehicle crashes, two with injuries.

In fact I would love to see someone that meets all three body comp standards.  Recommend all personnel that flirt with 39\" carefully digest the rule changes.  1.  The 25 BMI and 18% body fat standard adopted by the AF is the strictest permissible by DODI 1308.3.  Every other branch permits BMI of 25-27.5 and a body fat % that varies by age.  2.  The AFI guidance for measuring AC seems to conflict with the guidance for BFA.  AC requires the tape to be at the right iliac crest while the BFA requires the tape to be at the navel.  3.  The walk test no longer gives points.  4.  The charts in the back of the AFI do not go up to 81\".

While genetics do factor in considerably, with as many as 1 in 5 people with Crohn's disease having a family member with the disease, environmental factors are a huge contributor as well. If you live in an urban area or in an industrialized country, you're more likely to develop Crohn's disease. Because Crohn's disease occurs more often among people living in cities and industrial nations, it may be that environmental factors, including a diet high in fat or refined foods, play a role in Crohn's disease. People living in northern climates also seem to have a greater risk of the disease. Sorry for the confusion in the story.

Look for approaching storms.\n- Look for the following danger signs:\n- Dark, often greenish sky\n- Large hail\n- A large, dark, low-lying cloud (particularly if rotating)\n- Loud roar, similar to a freight train.\n- If you see approaching storms or any of the danger signs, be prepared to take shelter immediately...\n\nDuring:\n- If you are under a tornado warning, seek shelter immediately! Most injuries associated with high winds are from flying debris, so remember to protect your head.\n- If you are in a structure, go to a pre-designated shelter area such as a safe room, basement, storm cellar, or the lowest building level. If there is no basement, go to the center of an interior room on the lowest level (closet, interior hallway) away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls.\n- If you are in a trailer or mobile home, get out immediately and go to the lowest floor of a sturdy, nearby building or a storm shelter.\n- If you are in the outside with no shelter, immediately get into a vehicle, buckle your seat belt and try to drive to the closest sturdy shelter. Do not get under an overpass or bridge. You are safer in a low, flat location. Watch out for flying debris.

Kaitlyn first saw her Dad off on a deployment when she was just 1.5 years old. Then multiple TDYs, some last more than a month throughout much of the next decade. In the last 6 years, the kids have watched their Dad deploy 3 times in 3 years from Langley AFB, be geographically separated for 2 more years and have him home just on the weekends, missing many school and life events. Now, he's gone for a year overseas--as his son starts high school, Kate goes to prom and Ellie graduates elementary school--he'll miss it all. All 3 kids, Kaitlyn, Drew and Elizabeth, have done so much better than I could have. Poor Ellie doesn't even remember a time when her father has just been home--he started the cycle of deployments when she was just 3 and now she's almost 11. They're not perfect and it's sometimes pretty rocky, but they bear up so well and really try to pitch in and help out. Kate has been taking her siblings to some of their activities, freeing me up; Drew has taken charge of all the electronics in the house and being Mr Fix It; and Ellie has taken to organizing everything in the house! I'm just so very proud of them and a bit in awe at how they've handled the last 8 years.", "Comment_ID": "10151441120488692_9361230", "Commenter_ID": "10203485921181746", "Post_ID": "324251608691_10151441120488692", "Likes": 3, "Created_Time": "2013-04-09T15:45:37+0000"}, {"Comment": "Ours are 12, 10, & 6.

Right now there is no delay or closures for Langley. However if the base is put on a 2 hour delay like Eustis then the hospital will not open clinics until after the two hour delay and all appt missed because they were earlier would need to be reschedule. However depending on the clinic you are being seen in they may be able to squeeze you in but that would be up to the individual clinics and if they have room to squeeze you in between the other scheduled patients.

Sure let's get rid of the oil using a chemical when in fact the chemical did more harm than help. Seriously. I would not believe any \"label\" before I took it and tested it myself. Go dig up a few plants, native and invasive. See which one it kills then test it by putting it into a fish tank with gosh and crabs and oysters and test them to see if there is any chemicals in them, then do the same to the local wildlife species. Then if all that shows that it really only kills he \"bad\" plants and nothing shows up anywhere else then maybe consider it. I'm not trying to be a troublemaker although I know that is what it sounds like, and it is good you told people about it, but it seems like the govt in general takes the environment for granted. If it doesnt harm humans or animals would you take your child or dog out while it happens? And don't tell me it isn't where people usually go. If it's sprayed it is airborne meanin it goes where the wind does, and then gets into the ground, the ground water and everything.
