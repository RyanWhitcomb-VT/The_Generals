Since 1989, retirees and 100% disabled veterans and their dependents have been eligible to use these facilities. Today, only one is in operation, Edelweiss Lodge and Resort, located in Garmisch, Germany. In June 2015, a EUCOM (formally USAREUR) JAG reinterpreted the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and decided that all currently serving active and reserve component military personnel, all military retirees, all 100% disabled veterans and dependents, not assigned to or residing in EUCOM/Germany are no longer entitled to use Edelweiss, despite an official policy letter in 1989 that authorizes their use of the AFRC in Europe. The EUCOM CG accepted this reinterpretation/opinion. So, for over 25 years there has been no problem but on one opinion, our benefit vanished.  But now,  German military members, NATO military members, U.S. diplomatic officials and U.S. civilians employed by the U.S. government in EUCOM are entitled to use our facility. What an insult. A majority of U.S. military I.D. card holders are excluded while service personnel from other countries and our politicians can use our facility. Our earned benefit was stolen through an administrative decision, without the knowledge of our elected officials or considering the negative impact this has on so very many people. It does not matter whether you have ever used the AFRC in Germany or whether you will ever use it. This is simply yet another lost/stolen benefit. Since June 2015, congressmen/women and senators have been receiving letters of complaint over this loss, however, we are just now starting to see some movement in restoring our benefit. This action can easily be corrected with a change to AER 600-700 by the same EUCOM CG who denies us the use of Edelweiss. The German government did not cause this debacle, nor did the U.S. State Department.
     I am requesting that all readers of this information immediately write to your elected officials and ask them what they are personally doing to have this earned benefit returned. Some elected officials have responded in a positive manner while other have simply quoted the Edelweiss L&R eligibility criteria, which we already know. If you have not seen the new eligibility criteria, go to www.edelweisslodgeandresort.com and scroll down to ‚Äúeligibility criteria.‚Äù Be prepared for the insult.  Help us save this benefit. We are in a very critical period which will decide the fate of this benefit but we must maintain pressure on Washington.
   In this first quarter of 2016, we need many new letters of protest hitting Washington. Please complain to your congressmen/women and senators. If we let this benefit fade away quietly, what is next?",0,10153255923837231_10153300652077231,1.31709e+15,2016-01-15T13:48:57+0000,101027597230

I have been mandated by my government to get health insurance.  I have applied for countless Federal positions‚Ä¶but OPM won‚Äôt give me veteran‚Äôs preference points simply because of the dates of my service don‚Äôt match their criterion and that has cost me an unknown number of employment opportunities that I need!
WHY????
Was my service substandard?  I have three different honorable discharge certificates.

Did the recreational specialist in Colorado, who never served out of country or a day in combat do something I didn‚Äôt do other than serve during ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù time frames?

Why does he get the Veterans Preference Points for getting a Federal job and I don‚Äôt?

Why does my 4+ years of active duty, 5 years of National Guard and 3+ years in the Reserves count the same as a high school drop out on welfare who never wore a uniform for his country?

There are millions of us who are veterans yet get no preference simply because the dates we served weren‚Äôt convenient for OPM to recognize us for our service and give us the same preference as the hundreds of thousands who do get the preference points, but never left US soil or served a day of combat.

I served under the worst pay, didn‚Äôt get a GI bill and have no access to VA benefits.  Why are we being treated like we didn‚Äôt serve?  

Just because there was no war during our tours of duty doesn‚Äôt excuse the government and OPM from recognizing we were there and ready to answer the call.  

IF YOU SERVED, YOU SERVED!  All Veterans should be given preference when trying to find employment with the Federal Govt.

I have ready extensively about your career and have found that we have a lot in common. I know the upstate area of New York where you lived and went to Syracuse University, and, so many other things that you would think we were two pea from the same pod.  I will try to send you my residence phone number if you would like to talk before I get to meet you in person. While my time in the Army, I worked exclusively at the command level.  In Korea, I worked under Gen. Howze, when in Vietnam, I worked under Gen. Westmoreland (who actually became my father figure). We spoke to each other every morning before we spoke to anyon else.  I guess we were both giving each other a pep talk.  Those were some very bad days in the history of our great country.  Hope to hear from you on the phone, before your secretary makes arrangement for my appointment with you so you will know a little bit more about me, too.

When a fresh Soldier arrived, s/he would reside in what we called the reception center.  This particular building was located in the southwest corner of this area.  Generally, Soldiers would reside in one of these barracks around 5-7 days.  They would surrender their personal clothing, get clean shaven heads, draw their field gear and a few other down and dirty tasks.  Shortly after, each Soldier would be assigned to a basic training company where the drill sergeant would perform the belittling ritual which involved packing up everything in your duffle and marching ""across the street"" to a similar barracks for another 2 months of awesome bliss.  I can attest to the authenticity of the movie ""Stripes"" with Bill Murray.  The movie actually depicted both the barracks in the reception station and the company barracks ""across the street"".  As a matter of fact, for those who remember the end of the movie when Murray marched the rag tags onto the drill and ceremony pad, my barracks were directly behind the bleachers.  For those of you who want to see some authentic barracks, WATCH THE MOVIE.

Production Company To Transform Asphalt Road Into An 1800‚Äôs Era Dirt Road For Movie Shoot

 ELIZABETHTOWN, KY (October 28th, 2013) ‚Äì  Due to KYTC and public concerns regarding closure of KY 333 at KY 2199, the permitted event is rescheduled for this weekend.  Originally set to begin Tuesday morning and last through Thursday morning, it is now amended to begin at 2pm on Saturday and last until 3am on Monday morning.

 The closure is in the eastern corner of Breckinridge County, near the Meade and Hardin County lines and will allow crews from Antebellum Pictures to layer a dirt surface over the existing asphalt in order to create an 1861 setting for a movie shoot.

 Local residents should be aware of a signed detour that will be in effect.  Those traveling east on KY 333 from Breckinridge County will be detoured north to Bewleyville by turning right on KY 1238, right on KY 1735 and back to KY 333 to go south toward Big Springs.  Those traveling northwest on KY 220 from Hardin County heading to Breckinridge County will follow this detour route in reverse.  Mobile message boards are set up to alert motorists of the upcoming closure.

 As stated in the previous press release, emergency vehicles will be allowed to go through during the closure.

To ensure motorist safety before the roadway reopens early Monday morning, all dirt will be removed and the surface will be inspected.",0,10151693123837231_27200688,1.01028e+11,2013-10-28T13:03:16+0000,101027597230

226651,226651,226697,101027597230_10151053262317231,"Today, our Army will stand down to conduct suicide prevention training.  This is an opportunity to heighten awareness for Soldiers, Civilians, Families and communities about suicide threat factors, about the resources available for help, and about building resiliency across the force.  

I cannot overemphasize how important this issue is to me.  Every life lost to suicide is a tragedy to our Families, to our units, and to our Army.    

We must work together to create a culture and an environment where people feel comfortable getting the behavioral health assistance that they need.  Our Warrior Ethos states ""I will never leave a fallen comrade.""  I need everyone to take that to heart.  Every individual contemplating suicide has a friend, Family member, or leader in the position to help.  I need you all to get involved.  Intervening requires personal courage and leadership.  It isn't easy, but there is no room for bystanders.  

We are a resilient Army, and we are committed to building our individual and collective strength - physically, emotionally, socially, spiritually, and within our Families.  You must continue to refine and apply the resiliency skills you learn.  

Last week I visited Afghanistan, Djibouti, and the Sinai Peninsula where I had the opportunity to talk with, present awards to, and re-enlist Soldiers.  I am so proud of and humbled by the dedication and professionalism I see throughout the Army on a daily basis.  Every member of our Army Family is important, and we will never waver on providing you the care and support you so rightly deserve.

227121,227121,227167,101027597230_10150578963792231,"Ma'am, There are no ""Storm Shelters"" on Fort Knox, there are however many buiidling with basements and areas that would provide better shelter.  The Fort Knox IOC encourages all personnel to maintain a basic level of preparedness for all potential hazards.  Each of us has an innate responsibility as the first line of defense for disasters - to ourselves, our coworkers and families.
Tornadoes can happen anywhere at any time but generally are associated with Severe Storms.  We have advanced warning systems in place for most severe storm systems with our own certified weather forecasting station and access to national and local forecast information.  The Installation Operation Center encourages the Fort Knox Community to stay informed during such events through local weather, news, internet, cell phone apps, etc.
You are encouraged to get an emergency supply kit, make a family emergency plan and be informed about what might happen.  We ask you to check out Ready Army http://www.acsim.army.mil/readyarmy/. 

Fort Knox has mass warning and notification systems to alert the Fort Knox community.  We have multiple systems to maximize the potential for reaching all personnel:
* Sirens throughout the installation with varying patterns depending on the type of emergency broadcast.
* Voice notification systems using exterior speakers, commonly termed ‚ÄúGiant Voice,‚Äù and building interior speakers or sirens
* Interactive, community notification systems to provide voice and/or data messages to multiple receivers-telephones, cellular phones, pagers, e-mail, web banners, etc.
Additionally Fort Knox cooperates with local authorities and media for access to radio and TV emergency communication systems.
Tornadoes, are one of the most violent natural hazards, are rotating, funnel shaped clouds formed from thunderstorms.  Strong winds are their most destructive aspect with gusts reaching as high as 300 mph.  The damage path can be as wide as a mile.  Tornado season is generally March through August, but tornadoes can occur any time of the year.  Tornadoes most often occur at the tail end of a thunderstorm.  Eighty percent of tornadoes occur between noon and midnight.  While some areas are more prone to tornadoes than others, they can occur anywhere, so it is best to be prepared.

How to Prepare for a Tornado:
* Stay informed and know tornado terminology:
* Tornado watch-Weather conditions are favorable for the development of a tornado.  Stay tuned to the radio or TV for more information and further instructions.
* Tornado warning-A tornado has been spotted. Take shelter immediately.
* Identify a place in your home to take shelter in case of a tornado:
* A storm shelter or basement provides the best protection.
* Otherwise, choose an interior room or hallway on the lowest floor possible.
* Have frequent tornado drills
* If planning a trip outdoors, listen to the latest forecasts and take necessary action if threatening weather is possible.
* Get an emergency supply kit, and make a family emergency plan.

What to Do If There Is a Tornado:
* Take shelter immediately in the designated room.
* If you are outside, find shelter immediately or, if shelter is unavailable, lie flat in a ditch or a low lying area.
* If you are in a car, stop immediately and find shelter. Do NOT try to drive through a tornado.
* Stay tuned to radio or TV for information and instructions as they become available.
* Stay in shelter until the tornado has passed.",0,10150578963792231_20588032,1.01028e+11,2012-03-01T20:05:50+0000,101027597230
